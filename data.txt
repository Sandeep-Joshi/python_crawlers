not real good but definitely better i have also lost 10 pounds still having high sugar  levels in the morning my fasting there like 170 160 and 150 any suggestions of trying to get them down thanks tammy today checked, a1c at 7%
an a1c in the 6's is considered "good control" for a person with diabetes
one thing that really helped get my a1c down is to take about 2-3 units  of fast acting insulin about 2-3 hours before i usually get out of bed
i never gained the weight i originally lost but my a1c was 12 last year in feb and 11.6 on 6/26/15 - smart
my a1c was "over 14, and you're gonna die
doctor just called me this afternoon to check on me and said my a1c was 10
but the best news was a1c at 6.6, last time it was 7.4
i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
my fasting blood sugar was 230 and my a1c was freaking 12
as a matter of fact, my a1c went from 7.5 to 6.7 (no meds) by just cutting out rice, potato and wheat but increasing veggies
i managed to get my a1c down to 4.9 , cure my fatty liver
oh, and i don't take any meds for my type 2 and my a1c is 5.7   i guess i'm ok with how it's going for me
my doctor's office just called and told me that my a1c is 6.2
just curious, as i have just joined due to being shocked with my a1c report of 8 after years of being at under 6 to 6,1 until this last couple of years
i dropped my a1c almost 8 pts in the first 3 months &amp; i think it has a lot to do with the low carb diet &amp; being strict
his blood sugar a1c went from 9.9-6.1; clearly a change for 3 months, and his six months appt
your a1c likewise, is a snapshot of the average of your bg#s over a 3 mo time
by this time i have maintained blood glucose (bg) levels at or near normal levels, my last a1c was 5.5 and a year later i had lost 65 lbs
it was so high at one point that i was almost never under 300  my  a1c was 11.8 it is now 7.6
fyi, last a1c was 6.9
i have maintained my bg levels at near "normal" levels have had my a1c at 5.5 (may 2011) and have lost 50 lbs
i limit my carbs to 120 grams per day and have been able to maintain my weight at 120 lbs with my last a1c at 6.7
recently, i reduced my daily limit to 115 grams of carb per day because my a1c was creeping into the 7's
my last a1c was 6.9 and i'm shooting to get it into the mid-6's
my a1c is 5.8, my weight and cholesterol ratios are ideal and blood pressure is normal &hellip; and i feel great
tml english after close to 2 years on the insulin pump w/100 units of humalog per day, my a1c is 10.3
that your a1c is 10.3 is not good
my original a1c was 12
in six months, i have gone from a 13.2 a1c down to 4.7 - i have also lost 84.5 pounds
a1c was 5.5
my a1c numbers hover around 6.5
my last check up was 5/8/10 my a1c was 6.8 down from 8.9 3 months ago
i also follow a low carb diet and my a1c went from 14.1 to 5.9 in just a few months
that was too inspiring, my a1c is also in the range of 8 last 5 months ago the rest are all okay, im having a glucose intolerance and trying a change of my diet to lose weight although my weight is pretty normal for my age and height, my wt must be in 55 kg and not 63 kg
my last a1c was 5.4 and my total cholesterol number was about the same as yours
my a1c is 5.4
my a1c was 5.5
a1c to 5.5
my a1c was 5.5 and 95% of the time i test is in normal range
keep doing what you&#39;re doing and always remember that as long as you keep your a1c around this level to around 6.5% then you may not suffer diabetes complications
land mark trials reveal that with every 1 % rise of a1c beyound this leveel will raise the risk of complications to your eyes, feet and kidneys by 35%
my numbers are running 101 to 134, i have an a1c of 5.9, my blood pressure has dropped so that my cardiologist reduced my blood pressure medication by half
my a1c varies from 6.7 to 6.9 and has since i had my heart cath surgeries in early 2009
well, a non-diabetic a1c is 4.8-5.6
there is nothing wrong with being able to get lower a1c&#39;s with diet and exercise and no meds
i have one which i follow myself for the past 3 yrs, and i lost 65 lbs in the first 5 mo, and my blood glucose (bg) levels were normalized and my a1c was in the 5s all without the use of diabetes meds
tml english went to see the endo on friday and he advised me that my a1c was at 14.5
tml english my daughter who is 26 and pretty thin was diagnosed today with an a1c of 8.8 and a fasting glucose of 136
a1c 6.5
since i was diagnosed last yr my a1c level has gone to 6.7 from 6.4
my a1c has gone from 6.3 to 6.7 in the time since i was diagnosed and i have been pretty much on my own (with the wife) trying to figure things out
perhaps it could be a glycosated hemoglobin a1c reading (abbreviated "a1c") which is a measure of the average blood glucose readings for the past 90 days
i have developed a meal plan where i have stopped my need for diabetes meds,while keeping my blood glucose in the normal range, lowered my a1c to 5.5, and lost 65 lbs in 5 mo
and he really didn't see the point of even bothering with a meter, said let's wait and see how your a1c is in 3 months, and 6 mos
my a1c dropped from 11.6  to an a1c of 8
tml english i know what to do but i haven't been doing it,  my a1c went from 5.9 to 7,4
my a1c is 6.7 an hba1c of 6.7 means that your average blood glucose reading over the tested time period (2 to 3 months) was around 141 mg/dl
to convert your hba1c to an average mg/dl bg reading, gary scheiner in "think like a pancreas" offers this formula: (hba1c x 30) - 60
my concern would be that given "my bg is under 80, sometimes 60" when and how high is the hyperglycemia that makes the a1c 6.7 (which would be  an average blood glucose level of 150-160)
i have done all this my blood sugars were 300 my a1c was 12 now i wake up my sugars are 88 after meals they are no higher then 130
a1c results were 7.9
my a1c is just under 7 and my levels are dropping so that i went from metformin 1000mg twice a day to 500mg once a day, glipizide 5mg twice a day to 2.5 twice a day and levimir 14 units pm if level over 100 and 16 units am same to 6 units pm only if over 100
in seven months since i was diagnosed&hellip;doing what i am doing&hellip;i have lost over 90 pounds, my fasting blood glucose was last officially measured at the doctors office at 96&hellip;my current morning readings are in the low 80's normally, and my last a1c reading was 4.7 - i started out at a fasting glucose of 388 and an a1c of 13.2   those are the things i do
tml english i have a tendancy to (eat the fridge) when i am having a low lately, i cant seem to eat enough or get enough there for i get rebound highs anyone have any halpful tips i want to thank all of you for your kind words and insight i am the only one in my family on both sides that is diabetic so it is hard to talk to family about what u are going through i was on the pump a year after my diagnosis in 95 because i could not get by bs under 300 after a very long time working with different dr's because of several ins changes i just recently found a real good one who listen to me and with her help i am now off the pump and doing better than i ever did on the pump i am more aware of what i eat now, with the pump i got into the mind set every so often oh i have the pump i can eat what i want when i want and that got me into trouble  a couple of times, then i had a couple of pumps just quit working and i wound up in the hospital for the pump problems or tubing that wasnt working right, i have brought my a1c from 13% down to 9.5% and still working on it, i would like some insight on some filling foods so i dont get hungary so quick after eating and wanting to snack,one dilima i have that throws a twist into my eating to i guess is that i also have gastroparesis so anyone who has the same problem or advise feel free to let me know thanks for the input :) i tend to do the samr thing
you need to have your a1c below 7 stat
my a1c was 12.6 at the time,  my last a1c was 7.2  not that great for me as i know i can do better, but alot better compared to the 12.6 which come out to about 240 averaged
my a1c was an 11 and my doc was telling me foods to eat low on a gi table and i was wondering what kinda meals i can eat and drink welcome to the community
my a1c went down from 16 to 6.2 and i do still have some swings, although most days i'm pretty steady
found out today that my last a1c was 6.7, that is really good for me
came back and a1c is 9
thoughts about a1c being at 9
been back twice and my daily numbers are terrible and my a1c went from 6.8 to 7.9 in 2 months
i have been using chia seeds now for over 9 months, i can tell you it has made a difference  in my eating and my a1c i can happily say was 8.3 from a 9.1 and a 11.5
she had an a1c in the 6.5 range
one thing to think about with a1c levels is that the a1c is an average of highs and lows
when i had blood test my a1c was 14
my last a1c was 6.6
i was diagnosed feb 2009 with an a1c of 14.1
my next a1c in june of 2009 was 5.9
diane can you please tell me what it means when people say their a1c was 6.5
that is the total hemoglobin a1c for a 3 month period to determine if you are a diabetic,  basically it breaksdown and tells you all the junk that  is in your blood                or = 6.5 consistent with diabetes
as of the 7th of april finally i brought my a1c from 8.0 down to 7.0  by following information here on dc
i am in your camp of low carb eating, but people like my mom can eat all kinds of carbs and keep an a1c of 5.4
my last several a1c tests have been in the 5.4 - 5.6 with no meds
when i decided to go on a stict low carb high protein meal plan i managed my t2 without diabetes meds (had been on insulin) and achieved an a1c of 5.5 and a loss of 65 lbs
my last a1c on august 28 was 5.0 so tomorrow i am going to ask my doctor if i can quit the metformin
initial readings were 347 and a1c 11.7
a1c in may was 5.9 and a1c in august it was 5.0
my doctor had me come in immediately because my a1c was 11.9, cholesterol was 600+, triglycerides 6000+, fasting blood sugar 372
i have been able to get my a1c from 11 last aug
my a1c was 5.5 a year ago
my a1c is usually under 6.5,  i would love to get it under 6.0 but with a lot of stress in my life, i don't see that happening any time soon
my a1c goal is 6.5
i aim for 80 to 180 which results in my a1c in the mid 6's
trying to get back to a place i was after diagnosis ( under 100 pp and with an a1c of 4.8 but i got to complacent
i did this for about a month and lost 19 lbs and brought my a1c down from 9 to a 6.3
i kept this up and even got my a1c down to a 5.9
my a1c's are now down in the mid 6's with this small change
my a1c was 6.6 and my fasting glucose was 124.7
a1c below 7 (i would emphasize not lower than 6&hellip;you end up with too many lows trying to hit that number)
blood glucose between 80 and 180 is what i aim for (and this usually results in an a1c of mid 6's (6.7 last test)
hugs, pr the way i understand it is the a1c is the average of 3 months, so that seems to give room for a lot of ups and downs&mdash;in between if the average comes up within limts
ha&mdash;pr thanks everybody for your comments and help i went to my dr's office today for my massage and the nurse checked my chart and said your a1c test came back as 5.5 so no you do not have diabetes but you still need to track
as of my call into the office earlier tonight i aske the receptionist to have the dr write up a lab for that test so we will see if she does i will continue to be an advocate this time to why i am so sick "went to my dr's office today for my massage and the nurse checked my chart and said your a1c test came back as 5.5 so no you do not have diabetes"   go to another doctor or make sure they give you an oral glucose tolerance test
you cannot rule out diabetes based on an a1c, especially if you are testing your blood sugar and are seeing readings in the 180's and 200's
my a1c last month was 5.3
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
i took metformin for the first 8 years of being diabetic,it worked well i always had a a1c of less than 7&hellip;so its good for that&hellip; i can say that i had stomach trouble and always had gerd
one of them was that my a1c was over 12
when i was first diagnosed my a1c was 11.4  i don't know what my most recent one is as of yet  but in january i had it down to 7.1 but i was also enrolled in fitness classes while in college which ended in december i'm on metformin glipizide and losing prop as of now hiowdy velo welcome to dc
did you get an a1c done when 1st dx'd
i lost 65 lbs,  lowered my a1c to 5.5%, maintained my bg levels in the 80 to 130 mg/dl range
i had cholesterol level of 315,my pulse was 121 (set off the alarm) first time ever, had blood tests that showed i was pre diabetic, my glucose test there was 166 (fasting mind you) and she said my sugar levels were fine as my a1c was only 5.7 (6.0 is what diabetic association goes by) i only stated that i know they do not go by the a1c levels alone,she started to yell at me, telling me i was fine and did not need medication, i calmly stated that i did not ask for medications, she then closed her laptop and got up to leave saying this conversation is going nowhere
the a1c is a very cheap test, it's less than $10 cash and my insurance has worked out a rate of just over $3 with the lab i go to
mine does and i had been able, for the past 3+ yrs to follow a meal plan where i can manage my bg levels, achieve an a1c of 5.5, lose 65 lbs of weight (in 5 mo)  lower my insulin resistance, and keep my bg levels in the 90 to 130 mg/dl range
as a nutritionist i knew what to do, and have maintained a steady weight loss, never had a a1c over 7
nothing to do&hellip; no change in diet&hellip;just maintain to keep the a1c under control, take my meds as ordered, drop the caffeine to 1 cup a day, and exercise (which is not a problem &mdash; i take the stairs whenever i can)

but since my a1c's have been steady 5.4 to 6.4 for most of the time, except in those first years, dr
a1c was 11.6 and i was reported to have very high cholesterol
a1c was 11.6 and i was reported to have very high cholesterol
test your bs often, get your a1c down to at least 7
my a1c readings are between 5.5 and 6.3 on average most days (they were in the 8 range), and i am working to get them down even further, and i know i will :)  i am taking januvia, glipozide, and metformin (500 mg now, cut back from 1500 :))
my a1c has never been over 6.5 after leaving the hospital and has fallen since that time
confused and in denial harlen is right you are a diabetic, you can check with your doctor to make sure but my last a1c was 5.2 and i am still a diabetic
how did you go from a1c 13 to 4
down another 2 lbs, blood pressure 130/80&hellip; my diet looks great, but my a1c was up from 7.1 to 7.4
tml english i am a newly diagnosed type 2; my hgb a1c was 11 at diagnosis; have been taking my humalog 75/25 and my lantus religiously; have been counting carbs and trying to eat right; i have changed my diet drastically; got my 3 month hgb a1c and it went up to 11.7; cant understand with the diet changes and the insulin that my a1c is actually higher then when i was diagnosed
i'm finally down to a 5.2 a1c, but it took testing 8-10 times per day to figure out which foods did what to me and when to eat them
but when you say you've still got an a1c over 11, obviously you're numbers are running well over 200 regularly if i do my math correctly
i limit my carbs to 120 grams per day and my last a1c was 6.9&hellip;i need to get that lower&hellip;mid-6's is my immediate goal which means even fewer carbs&hellip;not easy but the results are worth it
my a1c was10.3  now its 7.1 and because of changing eating and walking,  i'm down from 247 lbs to 217
my tryglicerides was disturbing high because my blood sugar was a rollar coster running high an then low but more on the highside an when i got them lower an more on a leveled out my tryglicerides started coming down an there still coming down,my doctor said they will an not to worry or stress all that doese is keep you high,in time they will come down a 6 is not that bad on your a1c,keep up an watch your stress an card,exercise helps alote with the highs congrats on your a1c
her a1c right after that was a 6
thanks , thanks&hellip; i think you are actually referring to hemoglobin a1c or a1c which is an average reading of your sugar level over the last three months
my a1c was over 10
i am a brittle type 1 with a hba1c of 4.3 and that is what i can keep it at using my advanta jet&hellip; what is up with the diabetic community
you need to be looking at the advanta jet from activa&hellip;they make a much better product and i have been using it to control my disease for around 26 years&hellip;give or take a year&hellip;doctors don't seem to even know about it&hellip;i know it delivers exactly what i put into it&hellip;that is why the hba1c of 4.3 i use it all day long
a1c has not gone above 6.7, but seems to stay in at 6.5 for the most part
i have had a much easier time thus far with the a1c, my highest on record is 6.7 so i'm not too far off the recommended range
when my doctor first drew my blood my a1c was 11, but when it was drawn again in feb it was only 6, but he's the one that said go back to weight watchers and stay
but my a1c was down to 5.4
although your a1c is good &hellip;165 is a concern as you didn't say what your numbers were at diagnosis i would guess that you were "pre-diabetic" and its not unusual for doctors to show little concern since you are "just" pre
steve at dx it was 365 with an a1c of 11
my last hba1c was 6.6
tml english i went to docter friday and got my test results my a1c was 6.9 i was shocked because all my sugar was really high last two weeks been good some day high but mostly great numbers
my last doctor appointment the other day,  a pre-op check up,  my a1c was 6.1 m my un cholesterol was 98 amd my triglycerides was 122
you know that your a1c is the average of your bg 24 hrs a day for the past 3 months weighted for the last two weeks
a1c 6.6
good news : a1c went down from 9.6 to 7.4
my a1c dropped from 15 to 7.5 in less than 6 months and my doctor doesn't want it any lower due to my cardiac condition
my a1c has been below 6.0 for many years
last a1c was 11, i'm hoping my next one will be less since i've had a little better control
i've been eating healthy, taking my medication and have gone from a a1c of over 12 to down to 6.0
i'm a 5'3" female and limit my food to 120 grams of carb per day&hellip;not easy but my last a1c was 6.8, which indicates good control
my a1c was 5.8
my last hba1c was 7.0 so there is definitely room for me to improve in my control&hellip;it may be time to get the old food diary back out
although i was controlling my diabetes "pretty well" 6.0 a1c, had lost about 90 pounds but i smoked and was still 70 pounds overweight i realized there was a lot more i needed to do to prevent a second (potentially fatal) stroke &hellip; or a heart attack
i don't take meds and i have had three consecutive a1c's in less than 5.5
i liked bread as much as anyone; but, i have to minimize or totally eliminate bread to maintain a steady a1c in the 6's
thank you for the past 2 years my a1c has stayed between 5.0 and 5.4
howdy cj what you said brought to mind something that happened to my late wife "jem" she had bg levels in the 300s yet on one occasion she had an a1c of 6.0
since an a1c is an average figure for 24/7/90days that would include any lows she had (whether or not she felt them)
for example one doctor told me a 9.1 a1c was not so  bad and another told me for my age it should not be anything over 7.0, some people on the site said they were aiming for an a1c of 4.0 or 5.0 and i was told for a diabetic that could actually be quite dangerous
my doctor wants my a1c under 7.0, but was told that anything under 6.0 was too low
this week i've learned that my a1c is down to 5.74
i started out 304.5 pounds, fasting bg of 388 and a1c of 13.2 - in just over two months, i was down to 270.4 pounds, fasting bg of 112, and a1c of 9.2 - and i expect much better things as i am doing more to improve my lifestyle than i had been doing
my problem is i got complacent and put back on 3lbs and my fbs went from 88 to 91 and my a1c from 4.8 to 5.0 in 3 months
when i first started taking metformin, i lost 52 pounds and a1c registered 5.4
a1c is still under  6.0&hellip; btw,i have type 2&hellip;best wishes to you
exactly what i did&hellip;a1c=5&hellip;yes
if you're running an a1c higher than the 7's, you have a problem and you will suffer the consequences
the gorilla in the room is carb control to get to an a1c below 7
i went from 7.7 a1c to 5.6 in one year
speaking to her doctor he asked me if she was diabetic, i answered in the affirmative but told him that she was convinced she was cured since her last a1c to which he replied that her blood glucose level was 530 at the time of admission
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
my a1c has remained below 6 for 2 years now
my may 2011 a1c was 5.5 and i have lost about 50 lbs of weight
i got my a1c checked and it's 5.3:)now i will always eat healthy for the rest of my life &hellip; i know a diagnosis of pre-diabetes is difficult to hear, but it's also an opportunity to change your eating and exercise habits to improve your overall health
a truly normal a1c will top out at around 5.4 but that isn't the goal suggested by health organizations for diabetics
my latest a1c was a 6.7 &mdash; a new all time low
my a1c is now down to 6.1
did an a1c count and it was 6.6% (152) he said i had type 1
it&#39;s possible your doctor took a look at your family history and an a1c that&#39;s out of the &quot;non-diabetic&quot; range and decided there must be something
when i was in the hospital he did an a1c which read 6.6% the meds they had me on raised my sugar to 288 but was told that was just from the meds
a full panel scan of bloodwork to determine, organ functions, cholesterol, triglycerides and a1c  runs around $250-300 a whack
tml english a1c's were first available in 1976
(i remember 1988 and playing computer games on a dos system - before windows became household - lol) saw my doctor today and asked what my a1c was when he diagnosed me three weeks ago - it was 12.46
i had been struggling with my weight and my bg (blood glucose) levels up till then, but i was able to discontinue my twice daily insulin injections, keep my bg levels in the 100 to 130 mg/dl range, achieve an a1c of 5.5, lose and keep off 65 lbs for these 3 yrs
my last a1c was 6.8 and i'm expecting the next one in august to be lower
if you're not in control (a1c in the 6's) you're going to have a problem
this formula estimates bg readings from a1c, not a1c from bgs as this question requests
if your bgs are average at 140, your a1c would be about 6.5
my last two a1c test at the dr was within .1 of the results i had
here are charts but it can not really be accurate for the reasons mentioned i disagree because if the lab can formulate your a1c then there is a formula its not a formula per se&hellip;its measuring out the percentage of your glycated hemogloblin aka hemo globin a1c&hellip;this deals with the sugar our bodies have in it
he a1c is determined by measuring the percentage of glycated hemoglobin hba1c that is in your blood you can disagree all you want jshin
the a1c is a running average of one's blood glucose readings for 24/7 of the past 3 months which gives more weight to the past 2 or 3 weeks of the 3 months (90 days)
to find one's a1c you really need to go to a dr and have an a1c test done
(or there are special meters you can use to get an approximation of one's a1c, but they and the strips to do the a1c are rather pricey)   there is a calculator and a chart i have found on the web which gives a rather static (as opposed to dynamic &mdash; snapshot versus movie) feeling for what one's a1c might be
the new target for a1c is 7
why is everyone still trying to get a1c down to 5  or  less
those drugs are dangerous, if you can get your blood sugar to an a1c of 7 with out drugs, you will be much better off than an a1c of 5 and those drugs
i have never had an a1c below 7 in the last 20 years and i have no problems and don't take drugs
the real evidence is that the american diabetes association has changed their a1c target number to 7, no longer below 6
you keep saying that the ada recently  raised their recommendation for a1c to 7%
it is my understanding that the ada has never recommended a1c's below 6% &hellip; if you can show me something i would be very grateful
if the ada has had their a1c7  a long time, and i am not doubting what you say, then why are people being given drugs until they are 5 something
why not stop drugs at  a1c7  if that is safe
it looks to me like only when a1c 8 is or more that blood sugar becomes as dangerous than the drugs
getting  an a1c from 8 down to 6  with drugs doesn't prevent complications
diagnosed with a1c level of 6.5 4 months ago now 6.3 is it harder to get it below 6 without meds
however if you eat a very low carb and high protein meal plan you may well be able to get your a1c down to 5.5% without meds as i did
the ada did raised it's a1c target to 7, from below 6
without that information, you could get blood sugar of a1c of 5 and still have complications and heart disease
i have eaten low carb and exercised regularly and maintained an a1c at or under 6.0 since 6 months of diagnosis
both neurologists i have seen recommended keeping a1c under 6.0 steve, you neurologists follow the american diabetes association
i am not saying having an a1c of 6 is bad
what i am saying is getting an a1c of 6 or less often can be only done with the drugs
how many diabetics have felt guilty because they couldn't get an a1c of 5
the more recent guidelines are what i was given as far as mealtime bg, but was still told less tan 6 for a1c  i am at 6.4 and my brfore meal reads are consistently under 100 for the most part,but i am on insulin
sue what you were told about your a1c being less than 6 is obsolete
so what i think that i have learned is that our a1c should be between 7.0 and 5.5
out of sheer accident, i went and checked my a1c on feb 19, 2013
the results are as follows:   fasting blood sugar was 109   hb a1c was 6.9   gtt (75 grams of glucose tested after one and half hours) was 118   all the other tests were normal
over the past one year my a1c has been around 5.2
around ten days back my a1c was 5.1
my most recent a1c was 5.5
last a1c was 6.5 which is just right
the final arbiter is your a1c&hellip;the new normal is under 7 (6.5) is the new recommended level
i'm currently taking it three times a week and maintaining hgb a1c &lt; 6
i have lost 20 pounds, enjoy walking and doing 5ks, and have gone from an a1c of 7.4 to 6.1
right now i'm at an a1c of 15ishh, high cholesterol, facing diabetic neuropathy which means they're hoping its not permanet but i get it a lot, my "women organs" have stopped working lol uhmm constant dehydration which leaves me in and out of the hospitol, kidney malfunctions (so far not permanet), my pancreas is seeming to resist the insulin now so i have to take pills too, my scars are not healing, so i'm starting to look like a lepard with all of them&hellip;and exspecially the ones on my feet lead my feet to swell and go numb leaving me out of work and off my feet for days
her last a1c was 11
her sugar level was 736 and her a1c was 12.5
my a1c is definitely not the best, and i have been type 1 for over 15 years
i keep my a1c around 6 and have no complications after 26 years
november 24th, when my blood work came back, my a1c level was 6.5
my a1c runs about 5.5
my last a1c reading was 6.8 so i doing well with me diabetes
also got dizzy in sun at sea side heights last sunday even though i was drining lots of water&hellip; i was diagnosed feb 2009 with an a1c of 14.1
my next a1c in june of 2009 was 5.9
hba1c test result  9.7 here's some more information, mishraji
tml english doctor said i have type 2, fgtt numbers were high, at least one of them i know was quite a bit over the line to qualify as diabetic, however, the first a1c was below 6
i had a second a1c and it was even lower than the first one, around 5.4 is there any chance the doctor was wrong
the fact that your a1c may be variable like that (if it was under 6 i would guess it would be 5.9 and 5.4 is only 0.5 difference) could be due to hypos ("lows")
my late wife would have blood glucose levels in the upper 200s to 300s for weeks because she needed to use corticosteroids for other diseases she had,  yet  she would have a1c of 6.0
my last a1c was 7 the one before that was over 12
when my new doctor tests my a1c near the beginning of september, from my calculations, i expect it to be down from 6.4 to about 6.1
i am now thinking is my a1c of 6.6 bad
i maintain an a1c in the low 5's with no lows and no medication
(moegig) pt is not recommended for a diabetic to go below a 6.0 a1c level, the ideal level for a diabetic is between 6.0 and 6.5 according to both my pcp and many of the books that i have read concerning this subject
my a1c was 10
for the most part, i was doing everything correctly but still had an a1c of 10
with my continued healthy diet and whatever exercise i can get, my a1c is 5.9
my a1c has remained between 6.0 and 6.2 throughout the entire 18 years of managing my diabetes
i have had four consecutive a1c's in the low 5's
a1c slipped a bit from 4.9 to 5.1 (too many client lunches recently), however my cholesterol went from 149 to 136 and my trigs from 74 to 63
i was diagnosed with dm in the fall of 2003, a1c 8.9, &amp; started on 4 piils of 500 mg met , and 3 gliberide
i had gotten down to 2 pills of 500 mg met per day, with a1c's in the 5's
and then i saw people who led and active and healthy lifestyle, such as myself, who had a1cs as high as 14
a1c has to get into the 6's and taking insulin is the best way to achieve that
a1c has to get into the 6's and taking insulin is the best way to achieve that
my a1c still stinks @ 8.3, but&hellip; i'm doing my best
i was diagnosed 2 yrs ago (t2) with a bg of 1016, and an a1c of 16
i had maintained my bg levels in the "normal" range, lowered my a1c from somewhere in the 6s to a 5.5, and lost about 65 lbs over about 3 mos
james i was diagnosed with type 2 last august with an a1c of 14
7 months later, i've lost 50 lbs, my last a1c in january was 5.6, eat low carb and healthy, and exercise daily
i have dealt with it and have used my energy to get my a1c down to 5.6 and to overcome all the things that i felt was happening in my life
i am on the vgo insulin pump my a1c is 6.4 my blood sugar is never over 142
i'll get my first a1c level test next monday so for the past 3 months i really have ramped up the exercise and watched my diet but not overly consumed by it
i have been on a weight loss journey,  and still am&hellip;  there are plenty of days that i just feel like  saying "forget it"&hellip;  i have lost about 40 pounds and my last a1c is closer to normal&hellip;  (5.7)   sometimes i even rationalize that it is close enough
3 months ago my a1c was 7.6, which was only 1 month after dx
my starting a1c was 9.6 and in a short time i am down to 5.5 (dec
i have yet to have an a1c and i am wondering if i need to insist on one at my next appointment which is november 30th
cvs pharmacies are offering free a1c tests to diabetics oct 25 through nov 25:  http://www
y va providers want my a1c below 6 and i have gotten close to this mark now at 6.1
my wfie who also has type 2 has a doctor who is content with her a1c being around 8
between 5 - 6 and you don't need medication i don't think my dr has ever given me a specific goal for my a1c, but last month came in at 5.5 so we are both happy with that
my a1c is back up to 7.7 as of 7/17/15
my doctor is happy for my a1c to be below 7 which it has been for some time
my last a1c was 7.0
the hemoglobin a1c (hba1c) test for diabetes  http://www
most doctors follow the ada's standard of care a1c guidelines which are &lt;7 for most patients
(good job getting your a1c to 6.1)   steve my doctor is content with me being in the 7s for a1c but i want to be in the 6s for my own self
btw my last a1c was 6.9 is that good
my a1c was last measured at 5.3% so i'm not in a big worry state
i am type 1 and the pump has been a great and my last a1c was 5.9 from 9.8 and 10.0
am very impressed with the welcome and ammount of replies i have recieved and would like to thank you all for you have helped me to accept this diabetes thing a little better read my discussion titled "you have to be your own analyst" it may help you gain control and reduce your a1c1
my a1c was 11.5   it's hard adjusting to the needles and watching carbs/sugars
i've found that for me, i can maintain my 120 lbs weight  and an a1c in the 6's with 120 grams of total carb per day
my a1c is 5.5 and he said that he was really impressed with all of my numbers
that's amazing you were able to get your a1c down to that can you give me some advice as to how to lower my a1c mine has never been lower than 9.1% thanks
my fasting bg was 115 and a1c was a 6
but my a1c was 6.5, which is the lowest it has been since being diagnosed
well to make a very long storie short i stayed in the hospital for all of 2006 that was the year i became a diabetic and my very first a1c was 7.6 and i did not know what that was all i now that they said it was bad and when i went to class i learn a lot about every and i try to became the a1c champion for our area in order to do that i had to get my diabetes under control and i did the very next test my a1c 5.3 and has remained a 5.3 which is well below the american diabetes association average or national average
my last three a1c were 5.4.5.4,5.4
thank you hello and welcome  when i was dx my a1c was 12.9 now as of yesterday 5.5 and thats a lot of work for me i am very resistan and use 130 to 180 ut of insulan a day and on the pump this is a cud down from befor the pump i was using 250 to 300 ut a day my endo was so happy i had only 1 yelow box and that was from a kink in the line
my a1c is down from 8.6 to 7.5
trust me it was extremely hard i cried i didn't check my blood at all my a1c was 13+ i just didn't carebut you what when i learned my baby boy was coming it was a very big wake up call
tml english just got back my lastest a1c it is 5.5  it is a little higher then my last 3 a1c at 5.4 need to be more careful
alan my mom's latest a1c is 6.6, it's higher than previously which was less than 6.5
best wishes harlen thank you my friend, i will keep trying thanks alan that is great, alan&hellip;mine has never been that low&hellip;i see my endocrinologist next week&hellip;and, i am really worried about how my a1c is going to come out this time&hellip;my lowest was at my last visit, and it was 6.5&hellip;i was thrilled
over the course of the last year her a1c has gone from 6.2 to 6.4 to 6.7
my a1c was 14
in october, i had gotten my a1c to 7.1, january 5.6, and in april it was 5.4
mostly i'm doing very well, a1c was 5.8 and most of the tests came back normal
a1c was 7.9 a month ago
have no a1c #'s triglycerides were 3520 high cholesterol could not measure my bg was 245
tml english my a1c is 8.0
a1c was around 12
last a1c was 5.2
for me on my meal plan i got my a1c down to 5.5 , and lost 65 lbs
the second question in my mind is, can one prevent poor circulation complications with an a1c of 7
maintaining good circulation, blood pressure and cholesterol ratios, prevents complications of blood sugar of a1c7
by the way my a1c is 5.2 with no medication
so having an a1c of 7 without drugs, means the glucose level is kept at an average of 154
my a1c is 5.8, i take 500 mg of metformin 2x daily
which is why i just shake my head when people tell me their a1cs are 6.5&hellip;or 7&hellip;they are taking drugs/shooting insulin and they can eat grains and dessert with no problems&hellip;the insulin resistance causes the complications&hellip;not the symptom of the insulin resistance which is high blood glucose levels
i have had an a1c as high as 11 before i understood how to keep my blood sugar down
now my a1c is 7 and has been for a long time
my experience has been that even with high blood sugar, doing the things to keep circulation, blood pressure and cholesterol ratio as close to normal as possible had a protective effect even with an a1c of 11 for a time
i've maintained an a1c of 6.5 over the years and have no complications, but the low sugar attacks are scary
ou dont have to if you eat a well balanced meal,sorry to unload with some of this,but needed to get of my chest an dont mean to brag either about blood work,if it wasnt for dc  an all your help my bs an a1c wouldnt be where they are today,thanks for all the help in the last 2 yrs howdy jimmuel
but my a1c dropped too, down to 4.8, which is bad becuz it had been going up, it was 5.1 a few months ago
my a1c was a little over 7
i had got my a1c down from 12 to 5.9 in a matter of 4 months
my last a1c was 6.1
that was two months ago great a1c results&hellip;trying to get mine back down there (last one was 6.8)
my last a1c is 6.8, so there is room to improve
my a1c is 4.9
i was 63 and my blood sugar was 697 with an a1c of 13.2
my last a1c was 7.0, up from my previous 6.7 and i'm working to get it back into the 6's
blood sugar was around 800 and a1c was 14
test she said it was 135 av or 5.96  i'm not sure if i should be on meds or even if i am diabetic any help would be appreciated ,mike your a1c is within the normal ranges 4.5 to 6
my doctor is great but, the only way i found out i have a high reading is that i havent been feeling good for some time now and saturday i ate some pancakes and after that i had to lay down, and i felt dizzy, so i went to drug store and bought a kit, to read blood sugar and it was 180, i kept taking test until monday then contacted my doctor and she ran a a1c test, she called back , said my ac1 results showed a result of 135, and she want's me to  start taking some meds, i went to pick them up and they gave me the possible side effects from them, scared me to death&hellip; am i nut's or is this stuff metformen really dangerus
i let it go for the past three years, and went in last may to be told that i had developed retinopathy and was on the road to laser surgery and then blindness if i didn't get my bg under control and numbers below a1c 7
the la county free healthcare clinic took me off of my insulin pump and my hba1c is now 12.6
my bg was like 415 and my a1c was like 12.9
my bg levels are close to normal, my last a1c was 5.5 and i am doing it without the use of any diabetes meds
om/ip/relion-a1c-test/105
ha1c was 7.9
16 pounds lighter and a ha1c of 5.8
over 2 a1c points in 3 months
congratulations on dropping the a1c, plus 16 lbs&hellip;awesome
tml english my goal is to get my a1c to 5.6 or less
my sugars run 200 most days my a1c was 8.9 recently so i'm not doing so good endocrinologist ordered blood work so i won't know for another 6 weeks sadly but i will try that thank you i go thru the "i can't stand to eat another morsel" kinda thing
one year later i feel good, have nomal bs numbers, and my last a1c was 5.6
recommended re-test of blood sugar/a1c in 30 days and if numbers do not go down, not sure if oral (metformin) med will be prescribed
"the hba1c test provides us with an overall blood sugar average over the past 2 or 3 months
after 30 days, your a1c may be somewhat lower, particularly if you have changed eating and exercise habits, but a truer reflection of any corrective efforts you've made will occur after 60 to 90 days
tml english my last a1c was 5.9 and my new one is 6.4 but i think that is better
i just wanted to share a bit of my good news :) mary m a1c was also 5.9 a few months ago, and my ranges are terrible&mdash;-they were rated by an excellent doctor as being very very very poor
now , they said we have an even bigger problem: a1c i feel i need to raise, as i am very tired of lows in the 50s, yet, if i raise my a1c, they say i very well could go into ketoacidosis, as , i was almost admitted for it 5 times in the last 5 years
because i feel like i am trapped in an a1c of 5.9 for the rest of my life
i'm not mad at the doctors, just kind of wondering what's taking me so long to raise it&hellip;i have been that low of an a1c for 3 and a half years now, and each and every time my ranges were extremely erratic, in fact, i was almost hospitalized not just for strong symptoms of ketoacidosis, but for the fact that ever since the metformin 4 years ago, i have never been the same
it was consistently around 250, a1c 14.2, even though i ate no candies, cakes, and other "bad foods"
but, big to me&hellip;to keep my a1c down around 6.5 as it has been these past 3 months,  watch what i eat, stay on my diet and get to my goal or very close before 2013
get my a1c down to 6.5
i'm not overweight, never have been, and my a1c's range from 6.8-7.8, but now that i've gotten a cgm i've noticed that my bloodsugar is up and down alot throughout the day, which i am working on to correct
as long as your a1c is no higher than the 6's
then today when i found out that my a1c level was at 14 and that they were thinking about putting me on insulin
tml english hey guys got a1c test back 7.1 got to work harder on excercise and walking, wish me luck hope everyone is doing good, have great day great job
my last a1c was 6.8
his endocrinologist says he is an " uncontrollable diabetic" his humulin is on a sliding scale and his a1c last it was checked was 9.7
my feet are just burning a little an my buddy that got me into this has been on the water for almost a year now an his a1c went from 9 to below 7 in just a couple of months an his ldl also went down at the same time
sometimes we focus too much on our a1c and not enough on our overall health (something i learned the hard way) just sayin' &hellip; agree, steve&hellip;but a lot of the same things that work to lower a1c also help those other things&hellip;so it is a good thing to keep it down
after diagnosis (8 years ago) i lowered my a1c to 5.8 and figured "i was good"
tml a1c is a 3 to 4 month average of your blood glucose readings
my a1c numbers have not been higher than 5.1 since i got everything under control in the beginning
unfortunately, my a1c is still holding at 7.7 but hey, at least it hasn't gone up, right
i lost ground on my a1c but i'm determined to get it back in the 6's
anything under 180 fasting is good enough, and your a1c will most assuredly be under 7&hellip;which is all you need
my pcp would rather see older pwd's with an a1c below 6 (rather than 7) for just those same issues
the accord study claimed that an a1c below 7 took drastic measures to achieve, which for many of us would certainly be true
tml english i swear to god, somedays i feel like a lab rat&hellip;give ur lantus in the morning, no lets try it at night&hellip;no wait lets split the dosage up and do 2 shots of lantus a day instead of just the one&hellip;hell whats one more shot since u gotta take them everytime you wanna eat anything&hellip;and all the while being told that yeah for a few days after we switch this around u will probably roller coaster with your sugars but just until we find what works best for you&hellip;now i know that its all a process but i was kinda hoping after 25 years that part of the stupid process would be over with&hellip;i  have an appointment to be checked out for a pump, so pray for me that they decide thats  what they wanna do cuz im tired of poking myself 7 times a day and not having it even  itself out&hellip;was on th epump for awhile 7 years ago and it was great til the pump malfunctioned and they just never put me back on one, but my a1c was like 5.6 then&hellip;so keep ur fingers crossed for me everyone
as long as she can see you are working to get them down she should be encouraging not yelling, unless you haven't been really trying&hellip;your a1c should  be no higher than 7.0 or the equivalence of whatever the other measuring system is
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
i have continued my experement and normalized my bgs   over this past year i have pretty well normalized my bgs (except for the occasional slip up) and had my latest a1c of 5.5 (within the normal range) lost 65 lbs this past year to boot
achieved  an a1c of 5.5%, lost over 65 lbs during the course of 5 mo
they told me there i had a 580 blood sugar and a a1c level of 8.6
i was watching what i was eating and took smaller portions and snacked on good stuff in between meals to make a long story short i was able to go from 24 units on my pen down to 14 units,once i'm down to 10 units i can go on oral meds ,but you still have to exercise and eat healthy i will go get blood work done in 2 weeks to see what my a1c level is, since i cut back on my insulin my doc said imy a1c level will be much lower&hellip; dont be afraid to eat
i tend to follow a similar course and since i was diagnosed with a glucose level of 128 and an a1c of 8.6
my a1c has dropped to 7.1 in under 90 days
i am going to borrow some of your ideas as my goal is to get my a1c below 7 and as close to 5 as i can
i would have given up long ago if it weren't for members on this site,i would have just said i am fine,nothing wrong,because of doctor's not having the time to review my readings i had logged,and,saying that since my a1c was only 5.7 over 2 months ago, i am fine

we already know what it does to hgb a1c levels and to weight (remember one can of soda per day for a year can result in a weight gain of 15 pounds) but now it's shown that it may well impact the lipids that set up our patients for heart disease when they are older
3 months ago my a1c was 6.0 my dr
my fasting bs was 114 and my a1c came back 6.1&hellip; higher then 3 months ago and after changing my whole diet

keeping your a1c below 7 is very important&hellip;a blood glucose range between 80 and 180 should accomplish that&hellip;(that's what i do, anyway for the last 50 years)
my first a1c was above 10
yesterday she is pleased with my a1c it was 6, but still have to take meformin 1000 mgs twice a day and insulin am and pm humulin and humalog, craving for some kind of sweets, she said dark chocolate is good for me, any other good suggestions/ thanks, have a good day all i make sweets by mixing cocoa powder, dried coconut and coconut milk with crunchy (low sugar) peanut butter on the stove

this has brought down my a1c level from 14.8% to 7.9%
ask about blood tests (what you've had, what they mean and what you should have, eg blood glucose, a1c, c-peptide, insulin, antibodies, blood pressure, cholesterol, urine, etc), what are your goals going to be, how do you attain those goals, ask about supplements and herbs, ask about exercise and how to handle it, ask about wen and how often you should test, ask for prescriptions for 2 glucose meters of the same type and plenty of test strips to go with them, ask about when you should start to get concerned with your blood sugar and when you should call the doctor for advice, ask about the dawn phenomenon and the somogyi effect
my a1c 3 months ago was 6.7
my new a1c is at 5.7
my a1c had always been under 6 since getting bs under control with shots since dx almost 2 years ago
my a1c before going on pump was 6.1, 2 months after starting pump back down to 5.6
they did an a1c and determined that i was at 11.4% with an average of 280
my a1c is 8.4
pretty sure that even at this carb intake i can keep my a1c under 6.5% which is good enough right
for those members that don't know me &hellip; perhaps i should better explain my situation &hellip; i was diagnosed 8 years ago with an a1c of 10.0 and was put on 500 mg of metformin 2x daily
i started out staying under 150 carbs per day and within 6 months my a1c was down to 5.9
current a1c is 5.7 and although i was once down to 158 pounds (167 pound loss) i now weigh 170
in march of 2015, i had a a1c of 9.1 and it had stayed there since 2012
i gave myself 4 weeks to see if i could affect a positive change and along with a bit of exercise, i lowered my a1c down to 6.4 and lost 35 lbs
fast forward to my last appointment with the endocrinologist on 9/18/15, my a1c is now down to 6.2 with a loss of 82 lbs
many blessings, richard i thought the goal for a1c was 7
calayx my doctors want my a1c under 6.5
an a1c of 7 means your blood sugar average for the last 3 months was 150 doctors consider this the cut off point
an a1c of 6.5 translates to a bs average of 135 actually the goal is "normal" &hellip; my current a1c is 5.7 and have been under 6 for about 7 years
the theory being that complications begin at 140 mg/dl (or 120 depending on who/what you believe) so an a1c of  6.5 equals an average blood glucose of 140
steve a1c under 6.5 is on the chart i have and mine was 6.0 two days ago
i am maintaining an a1c of less than 6.5 and i am ok with that
if i can keep my a1c in the 6
my last a1c was 5.9, and i have a feeling the next will be a little lower
good luck and keep fighting the good fight steve,  putting a "smart" carb limit and an a1c goal of 6.5 is a win-win situation, way to go buddy
i ate a large bowl of oatmeal every day for almost two years and maintained an a1c under 6 &hellip; i would focus on keeping the carbs i do eat to low glycemic load and of course, whole foods
my a1c of 4.7, 85 pounds lost in eight months, and dropping 2 out of 3 bp meds would kindly disagree with your assertion of dr
from 13.2 a1c down to 4.7 in six months is it's own testimonial to the effectiveness of dr
on a happier note, my a1c is only 7.1 now
my a1c is at about 11.5 which is better than aboiut 2 years ago with an a1c of 15 but i still have this feeling of hopelessness i guess that i will never be able to fix this
a1c is right at 7.0, while not terrible, is a bit higher than my md wants
when i was first diagnosed, i was put on merformin, which now i don't think i should have been, since my a1c was only 5.6 at the time
i weigh around 120 lbs and my last a1c was 6.6
my a1c was a whopping 15 when i got my labwork done
when i first found out i was diabetic almost 3 months ago my bs was at 695 and my a1c was 15.4
my previous a1c was a 10.2
imagine the shock for both of us when he came in and glowingly reported my a1c - a 7.0
i have yet to see clinical data to support his opinion of having a blood sugar greater than 130 mg/dl will lead to diabetic complications (a recommended a1c of 7.5 is an average blood sugar of approximately 150 mg/dl)
my hga1c has been between 5.2 &amp; 5.9 for 8 years, and i do the best i can
i dont thnk for one minute that just because my a1c is always 5.3 - 5.4 that it will alwys be that way and while my doc says test once a day, i try to do that every day at various times
my a1c's have been no higher than 6.9 in the last 3 years
my last a1c was 7.3 i'm usually within my range under 130, but this is due to me taking the right insulin dose
tml english got my a1c done today&hellip;5.8
the good news is that i was aware of my genetic history so took the proactive route and had my pcp test me on a regular basis that's why my a1c's never got higher than 7.5
on this meal plan last year, i normalized (or close to it sometimes) my blood glucose readings, had an a1c of 5.5, lost 65 lbs in 1 yr and reduced the pain in my feet due to diabetes related neuropathy
since we were unable to cook proper meals i've been eating the junk i use to just in smaller portions, i dread to see my numbers when i'm finally able to test again&hellip;not to mention i'm scheduled for my first post diagnosis a1c next week i am in nc and we got 15+ inches of snow, but luckily didn't lose power
hi&hellip;have not had this problem yet&hellip;but after many years of t1, i've tried to be mostly in control&hellip;a1c typically in the  6's&hellip;aim for 80-180 blood glucose
i almost lost the battle, my bg was 880, and my a1c was 14
i am motivated :) thanks again well my a1c last checked was like 10.0 and that's the lowest i've gotten it
at that time a1c was 11.6
he pulled out three bottles of medication and bragged he keeps his a1c under 7&hellip;i kept my mouth shut&hellip;just told him i preferred to eat this way&hellip;but he kept going
i asked him how many meds he took when he was first diagnosed&hellip;he told me only metformin&hellip;then i told him i eat my crazy diet because i don't want to end up like you in eight years taking three different meds to keep my a1c down and told him if he didn't stop eating the way he does the next step is insulin&hellip;yep it wasn't pleasant&hellip;his wife made him stop and told him he asked for it&hellip;the next 40 or so minutes went on forever&hellip;i swear i don't know if i should be more angry or more saddened,,,,,i should of controlled myself a little better and i feel bad&hellip;but dude asked for it&hellip;i hate it when people judge me and my diet&hellip; jibber: whatever you do don't feel bad&hellip; you were kind enough not to put him on blast for what he ordered but then for him to belittle the fact that you actually care enough about yourself to eat what you should instead of what you might have liked is beyond rude and completely unfriendly
hi rabbi ,   morning bg depend heavily on your dinner , 99 mean you took heavy dinner , just try it with light dinner i just want to share my story,   a month ago for the first time i got my a1c and it was 208
my a1c is at 11.8 :-0
a little over 6 months ago my a1c test was 10.1
this past september my a1c was 13 and the next one was 7.1,,,,,and then i sort of messed up so i was afraid to even know what it would be so i went to the local drug store and bought an  a1c kit to do at home, it was kind of expensive but it had 5 kits in it, so now i can take it when i'm concerned
14349-lowered-my-a1c-8-points-in-90-days
got my test results back and in 3 months i have brought my a1c from 14.2 down to 6.7
tml english i was at the doctor yesterday and my a1c level was 5.96
31933-a1c-at-5-7
a couple of months ago i took a a1c test and it came back 5.7
there said if someone came in there with an  a1c was 6.1% they would not treat with meds, which we all thought was crazy
i am pre-diabetic with an a1c of 5.7 that my doctor seems to think is no big deal
how is your a1c down to 5.2 but you're still diabetic
however, you can go into a sort of remission which a nurse told me early on, when my a1cs were consistently at 5.5 then 5.4 and then 5.3, so she said i had done that but to be very careful what i ate and to continue to exercise like i was
a1c 5.7%
right now i think it's my a1c level being 5.7
i started with a a1c of 9 and with medication brought it down to a 6.1
currently my a1c is 6.2
my doctor recommends a higher a1c close to 7.0 to minimize my number of lows
my last a1c was 5.3 in november but my hubby has had so much trouble with his sugars he has been very discouraged until we went for his doctors visit a few weeks ago and got the results of his a1c
as far as losing weight i have developed a meal plan on which i was able to discontinue my diabetes meds, lose 65 lbs in the course of 5 mo, achieve an a1c of 5.5%, and generally keep my bg levels in the 80 to 130 mg/dl range
my initial a1c was 12.6 and now my last was 7.2 so i still have a way to go to get to my target
bs is usually around 110 fasting, last a1c was 6.8 in december i have had dysphagia for several years (inherited from my mother) i am tryins to find someone else that has this and what they do to contend with it
here it is almost 3 months later&mdash;i am down 40 pounds, blood sugar has gone from 330 to avg of 95-100 and a1c went from 10.5 to 6.8
my last a1c was 6.1
i manage to keep my bg levels at 80 to 130 mg/dl and have an a1c of in the 6% range
i then inquired specifically about the a1c and she said it was 6.1
this apparently works as my a1c is now 6.1, down from 6.5
i use it for bp and bg and for my a1c1 and my weight
i try to limit myself to no more than 120 grams of total carb per day and have been able to maintain my weight at around 120 lbs; my a1c's run 7.0 or below
i was diagnosed with an a1c of 10.7
i took my a1c at home a month ago and got 6.4, i hope the home test is accurate,  i have gotten a few readings in the 90's over the past couple of weeks, but not often
my a1c was 10.6 when i was diagnosed
i am vitamin d deficient back to a good range now my last a1c was high due to steroids but once off them it dropped 2 points
i had gone for an annual physical and my a1c came back as 7.2
after 3 months i had my a1c retested and came back with 6.9
in another 6 months i retested and had an a1c of 6.5
my a1c hovered around 7 all that time
i have had a1c between 8 and 11 at times early on before i figured out the diet thing
i am hoping for an a1c below 6 (and for good cholesterol)
my doctor or i either one thinks that is the cause, since my a1c level is 5.3 and the highest bs level i had in the past year was 135
tml english i'm recntly diagnosed with a a1c of 6.5
my may a1c was 5.5
i was hard-headed about it all to begin with and am paying the price dearly for it but after working sooo hard and giving up soo much i finally have my a1c down to 6.3 and am much happier and healthier for it :)
my a1c went from 11.2 to 7.1 in 4 months
my blood sugar was 400 and my a1c was 13 i was just in shock
generally speaking i maintain a bg level in the 80 to 130 mg/dl range achieved an a1c of 5.5% and lost 85 lbs over a 5 mo period without a lot of excercise
intelligence and good looks&hellip;grin yup &hellip; apparently the "rules" of diabetes do not apply to me &hellip; particularly the myth that if you keep your a1c under 6 you won't have complications &hellip; "charm
my a1c has stayed at 5.7 all of this time
tml english i was doing great with a1c's of 6.9 and 6.7 but without a diet change i am now at 11.9
my bgs average 100 - 140 and a1cs around 5
i changed my way of eating and i had been injecting insulin 2x a day, but after that i kept my b g (blood glucose) levels in the "normal" (80 to 130 mg/dl) achieved an a1c of 5.5% and also lost 65 lbs over 5 mo time
i did it a few times to many over the holidays so i was really worried that my a1c would be higher this last time so i was really excited to see that it dropped .4 more
my a1c was 10.3 &amp; now is 5.3 so i'm doing good
i am planning to to get my a1c to 7%
my goal is to lose weight my a1c is 8.6 it was 9.6 three months ago so i'm trying to get down i was going to the ymca everyday but i have bad feet and all the working out has given me bone spurs in my feet i'm trying to stay active but its hard and then sometimes i just want to eat its hard to stay motivated my goal is to gain weight in muscle
my goals are a bit lofty&hellip;i don't believe in the phrase "normal for a diabetic"&hellip;i want normal&hellip;so my goal is to get my a1c into the 4's&hellip;i am currently at 5&hellip;a little tip&hellip;my a1c fell  the most
calayx my goal is to get my a1c back to the mid-6's (from 6.9) and to do my 3-mile 50 minute walk every other morning
i don't need to lose any more weight so my goal will simply be to get my a1c below 6 if i can
waiting for my latest a1c result and if over 7 guessing a med change
tml english my a1c went from 5.9 to 6.3
i think your a1c is great my endo says to try to always stay below 6.5 so congrats
the panel that wrote the guidelines endorsed an a1c goal of less than 7% for young people with type 2 diabetes, but noted it may be adjusted depending on the person
y a1c is around 7 which is pretty good compared to where it has been in my past
my last a1c was 7.0&hellip;i want to get it back into the 6's
right now, i can achieve an a1c in the 6's with tests and shots and vary my intake and correct for it
89 my a1c went from 10.8 to 5.8 lost 42  pounds in 4 months low carb diet was it just the low carb diet or are you on any medication
good luck what i was saying is if my a1c test came back 5.8 on 500 mg metformin a day why would he up me 3 times the amount if the small amount and diet was working
right now i am on course to an a1c of 6%-6.1%
i just took a home a1c test and tested 6.7
does this mean i now am a diabetic, the box said anything over 5.9 was a diabetic reading, my last dr ordered a1c was 5.9
tml english i have been a diabetic for 18 years i have tried shots and pumps i am currently back on shots and taking levimer but was hoping to get some input on other insulins since my a1c is at a 15 and my sugar will not come down unless i take novolog every hour and i'm taking 30 to 40 units of it at a time just to get my sugar in the hundreds update: talked to doc today she doesn't want to change my insulin she has decide to put me on 40 units of levimer in the morning and 40 at night and a sliding scale with my novolog i take humalog and lantus(when i'm on injections, for my pump it's just humalog) and it my opinion, they work like a charm
i took levimer during my pregnancy with my daughter and had an a1c of 7 the whole time she is now a year old my sugar has been out of control for about 8 months now i switched doctor because the last one wasn't concerned with anything my new doctor is tryin to adjust my insulin but i've been doing that for months now and nothing is work
:) on march 4th i went to my clinic and my a1c was 7.4 which is better then the time before then
my a1c was 5.8
my 05/2011 a1c was 5.5
i like my a1c around 7
they sometimes scare you half to death that if you don't have a a1c of about 5, your are going to  get complications
my last a1c was 5.4
in that time my a1c went from 6.1 to 5.8 and i got off statins &hellip; coincidence
i kept my a1c in the high 5s for 8 years doing this
i lost a bit of weight, took my meds and figured since my a1c was right at 7.0 i was okay
my cholesterol and blood pressure are excellent and my last a1c was 5.9
my a1c was 15.9 i just got the results from last week's a1c test and it's down to 7.9
but sure enough, my blood sugar was 435 with an a1c of 12.0 and i was spilling sugar into my urine
my a1c was 15.2 in june last year and my diet changed quite a bit, as has yours
with the metformin and diet change my a1c was 6.2 at 3 mos
i still struggle but i've brought my a1c down to 7.5 and my endocrinologist is delighted
tml english when i was diagnosed aug 3, 2010 at a blood glucose of 397 and a1c of 13.7, i never believed i would work so much at getting to 100
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
i know my current a1c, but i don't know when an a1c was taken prior to my dx in jan
i go back in may and will have another a1c and then i will know two, and i will know future a1c's
but not loosing any weight&hellip;  i should mention that when my sugars are good i seem to gain weight (they are not perfect but my a1c came down to a 7.8)&hellip;my doc wanted to see some weight loss
my most recent doctor appointment showed a decrease in a1c from 6.8 to 6.4
today was her first endo visit since going on the pump, her a1c went from 9.6 in april to 7.4 today, which i thought was really great but she also went from 112 pounds to 107 pounds, she is 5'4 1/2 so under weight still, is it common to lose weight when a1c drops
her doctor did not say anything just that they want her a1c under 7.5 but the more i think about it the more concerned i am
i have kept my blood glucose pretty much in the normal range, my may 2011 a1c is 5.5, and i have lost about 50 lbs in 7 months
my last a1c was 7.0 but i want to get it back into the sixes, so am trying to eat fewer carbs and exercise more
tml english hello i've never been on anything like this but my endocrine says this might help me to talk to other ppl sooo i'm 20 i've been diabetic for 18 yrs since i was 2 and i've never been able to get myself under control my a1c is always 13 or higher so i'm just hoping ppl on here are supportive and i'm able to vent and talk about things with ppl who understand so is this sight supportive
i am not certain it would be helpful for me to compare my a1c's with yours, but i will tell you how i am able to keep my a1c's low
my fasting bs was in the low hundreds or high 90's to my pleasant surprise until my a1c came back at 6.7 and i was shocked
and he is diabetic type 2 a1c of 11
still my a1c is like 8+
my a1c in late august was 6.8, i won't get another till early jan
my a1c was 5.6, super cool
tml english i recently got an a1c test and the doc said it was high and i am right at the numbers for type 2
last year, my a1c was 5.0%
last week my a1c was 4.8%
the two test you had done are not equal in that the a1c measures your blood glucose over a 60-90 day period
but since my a1c's are pretty consistent in the 6.1-6.3 range, i guess i am doing it right
i've been on this plan since feb 2011 and in may my a1c was 5.5
i really like the ease of control and on an month and a half my a1c dropped from 9.6 to 8.1
i can not match up the insulin with my digestion and my a1c was around 17
34743-how-can-i-get-my-a1c-from-7-6-to-7-0-in-one-month
he says that my a1c must come down to about 7.0 before surgery and my bmi should go from a 26 to a 24
my a1c is 6.4 and my bmi is 23
i bumped it up to twice a day every day and my a1c came down to 5.7
i just got my results back on my a1c and it is at 5.7 also
in that your a1c is a look at the glycation of your hemoglobin over a (roughly) 90-day period not sure you can do a lot &hellip; but &hellip; you could try cutting carbs to as little as you can comfortably stand and trying to increase your red blood cell count by increasing your intake of iron and b and e vitamins
i went from a very high a1c of 14.2 to a 6.2 in two months
i've dropped my a1c to 7.2 now by being mainly vegetarian, and also dropped my blood pressure
a1c under 7, under 8, something else
my last a1c was 5.1 and i am averaging around 95 to 100 bg
fear of failure makes me go to the gym and run (not walk);  eat a low carb diet; and achieve an a1c in the 6's
my a1c (the 3month test) is down from 9.4 to 7.2 since april
i started out with an a1c of 13.2 - two months later i was at 9.2 and i expect even better results in september when i have my next a1c test
i weight 123 lbs, am 5'3" tall and my last a1c was 7.0
i'll need to cut back on my daily carbs because i want to get my a1c back into the 6's
this is why my latest a1c reading 2 months into diagnosis was 9.2, down from 13.2 - it's on it's way down, but did not have enough time to fully register the good things i am doing
howdy marsha hemoglobin a1c (or "a1c"for short) is a measure of how high your bg (blood glucose) numbers have been 24 hrs a day for the past 3 months, weighted heavier for the past 2 or 3 weeks
and my last a1c was a 6.5
my last a1c was 9.2
this is what has brought my a1c down to 6.3 so far
a year ago, i was able to tolerate 120 grams of carb but my a1c kept inching up and i want to keep it in the 6's
my last a1c in september was 6.9
tml english quite proud of my stability, dr called w results from last friday blood work, dam they were quick, a1c holding steady @ 5.7
my may 2011 a1c was 5.5
my a1c is 6.5 the dr said i have it under control
they did any a1c test and my a1c was 6.1 percent which means my average blood sugar is 117 and that is only .1 percent over than what someone with out diabetes should be and that if i keep trying harder if should keep going and i think its really good and i have also lost more weight and that my first a1c test was like at 8.1 percent and so it really has gone down and i am very happy about that and after hearing that at the doctors i had a really good day the rest of the day and that i also got to spend the whole day with my awesome mom
that's a good drop but a truly normal a1c is about 4.6-5.4
i've limited my carbs to no more than 120 grams per day which i am now reducing to 115 grams because my a1c is creeping up&hellip;if that reduction doesn't yield the results i want, i'll lop off another 5 grams
tml english lately i've been doing a lots drinking need help with controlling drinking my a1c 5.7 not  testing bs everyday i know it's hard to quit drinking i pray for you that you are able to beat this demon
my a1c started to rise past 6, as well as morning blood sugars
tml english "what's the trick" someone asked today when they heard james baker and i both have a1c readings of 5.7 and we are doing this with diet and exercise, and without medication
my a1c is now 5.7
my a1c  has never gone below 6.0, however i am satisfied with my numbers
my bg is usually in the high 80's to 90's and have an a1c of 5.5 or lower
over 3 yrs ago i discovered i could go on a low carb high protein meal plan and i not only lost 65 lbs, i also achieved an a1c of 5.5%, maintained a bg (blood glucose) of 80 to 130 mg/dl and was able to discontinue my twice daily injections of nph insulin
my a1c went from 11.4 to 5.7, and blood pressure from 157/108 to 123/68
my a1c recently came back reallllly high (11) but i never experience any feelings of high blood sugar that i know of
when i was first diagnosed (4 years ago) i had a really high a1c like your 11
i have been considered in control for almost two years now and my latest a1c was 5.4 it will take time, but you will feel different
i had am a1c of 7.1 before and know i can do it
my last a1c was 5.4
with the byetta, 1000 mg of metformin twice a day and 10 units of lantus i am keeping my a1c below 6.5 for the first time in years
in the meantime i developed diabetes, lost 50 pounds, and thought that as my a1c was always between 5.5 and 5.8, and the blood pressure was 110/60, i could drop some of my meds
they were 7.8 and from loosing some weight my a1cs are now 6.1
i got my lab report and my a1c is down from 8.6 to 7.5
good that my a1c was the same as last time, 7.4
i'm been so good with my sugar levels, a1c is at 5.5 use to be at 7.8 five years ago

they either predict their a1c using their meter average and are upset when their real a1c is higher or they compare their estimated bg to their meter average and are upset when the chart is higher than their meter, or they question their meters accuracy
i thought the ratings for a1c like 6.5 as very bad was a bit funny as some start at 14 and higher when they reach an a1c of 7 that is something to celebrate about
i thought my starting a1c of 10 was very bad
i am on no meds, last a1c 5.3, exercise regularly, and the other morning that is just what happened to me, and i don't know why
if it is an a1c then you are just a bit higher than "normal"  my latest a1c was 5.5, which is considered the upper range of normal but i am due for an a1c soon
i got that a1c of 5.5, pretty well normalized my bg levels (when i behaved) and lost 65 lbs within a few months of starting
the doctor called me the next day and told me my a1c was 9 but what concerned him was the 37 blood sugar reading
there is a section 'equating hba1c to average plasma glucose' that starts at 5% goes to 12% with an average plasma glucose number next to it
it shows hba1c of 7% and avg glucose number of 170
they also did a blood draw a1c test at the hospital (the tests were two weeks apart) which came in at 5.9%
i thought this a1c was for robin&#39;s daughter
he, however, wanted his own blood work so he did it, my pre diabetes showed up and he took it very seriously, did a 3 hr glucose test and checked my a1c it was 6.5 immediately wanted me on metformin and statins, glucose monitoring and baby aspirin even though my treadmill test was perfect a year before
i'd like to know exactly what they are,  but i like my breeze 2 a cup heck machine  i had gotten my hgb a1c down from 12.5 feb 2012 to 6.5 april 2013
once i got my diabetes under control, i have been able to stabilize and keep my weight in the 120 lb range and keep my a1c's in the 6's
i don't exercise and don't have a special diet, and my a1c was 5.9 you may wish to do a little it may just help you more
my a1c runs 6 to 7 consistently
i have usually had an a1c of 7.1 or 7.0 but this year my a1c went sky high
soon i only forgot to test and bolus at school which made my a1c 10.7, and it has been really hard for me because of all of these events to test and bolus
i took my a1c from 12.3 down to 6.1   there is no reason that you shold not be on insulin if you trully care to be on insulin
i did something simular over the last ten months and my a1c went from 14.1 to 5.6 in seven months
y a1c is 7.1,am 76 years old and do take high blood pressure medication
can't eat just one peice of chocolate or candy after afew hand fulls and a gallon or two of water later my socks are holy from too many dashes to the restroom, my part i guess you could say was just ignorance of a problem ,if i could manage that better ,who knows it may not be to late although the causes between type 1 and 2 may be different, the goal of the treatment is identical&hellip;and that is to achieve an a1c in the 6's
now, the means to achieve that goal (a1c in the 6's) might be the same or different if your pancreas is generating some insulin (type 2), or none (type 1)
a few years ago when counting carbs my a1c was 6
i'm med free because of dietary changes and exercise and have an a1c of 5.7
5566-is-an-a1c-of-6-diabetic
i had a doctor tell me i was diabetic because of my a1c hitting 6% but 2 weeks later a different doctor told me i wasn't
now my a1c was like 7.5 so i would listen to what your doctor is saying
normal human glucose levels: 4.3 - 5.5 % (70 - 108 mg/dl)   a1c level of 5.6 - 5.9% blood glucose has exceeded the normal upper limit of the assay range, indicating an abnormality in the expected normal human range
an a1c level of 6.0% or greater represents a high risk for diabetes mellitus
most non-diabetics will have an a1c of low 4's to low 5's
a1c hasn't been recommended as a diagnosis tool until recently and "they" decided that 6.0-6-4 is pre-diabetic and 6.5+ is diabetic
by testing before and after each meal and eliminating foods that spike my blood sugar more than 30-40 points, i was able to reduce my a1c from 14.1 to 5.9 in less than 4 months
i will have my 2nd a1c on feb 22st
i'm just confused since a1c of 6 seems to be some kind of borderline
my a1c went from 14.1 to 5.4 in less than a year
(i do not have a cgm "continuous glucose monitor) i've succeeded in getting my a1c's back into the 6's but want them in the lower 6's so still working on that
tml english i feel that i have to lie about my blood sugars cuz my dad puts so much pressure on me about them and want the perfect a1c of 6.8 which is never gonna happen for me
at any rate, i met with this new endo, loved her, complied, got my a1c down to 8 in feb
my most recent a1c was 6.4 and i am shouting that from the rooftops
and a1c came back 7.5 that's why dr
my may a1c was 5.5
my (now deceased) bride had a1c of 6.2
when i asked her endo about it, he pointed out the a1c is an average of bg readings over 90 days
i started with 10 a1c and 7.5 doesn't sound that bad and i know it is something to keep after because those numbers can to up
hi, had pills before but a1c was still 10 with insulin it is down 7.5 and at one time  7.1 so i think i have to work at it
my bs was 720 and a1c 13.9  they are not sure if i am type1 or type 2
i was diagnosed in august t1, immediately was placed on no more than 45 g of carbs per meal, my a1c was initially at 8.7 than in dec was 6.6, working to get below 6.0
my last a1c was 9.6, today it was 7.4 and had lost five pounds since my last visit a month ago
the a1c is a 90  day  rolling average of what your total bg levels (not just the readings but the 24 hrs a day average) of how you have managed your diabetes
i'm type 2&hellip;a1c 7.4
my a1c check was in august and was 6.5
tml english my doctor has told me that my a1c shouldn't go below 6.5 as that is considered normal for t2 and any lower isn't healthy, but i keep reading people crowing about how theirs is much lower
clinical studies of diabetics have shown an increased mortality when an a1c goal of less than 6.5% is attempted (with medications)
but - clearly, many type 2 diabetics - can completely reverse their disease and lower thier a1c back to normal (often into the low 5's) with no medication at all
so the point may be - pushing a1c below 6.5 with medication is dangerous, but is beneficial with lifestyle change
diabetes care and treatment should be catered around "that" individual and in saying so, your ideal a1c should be determined for you by your doctor although a prolonged a1c over 7.0 can begin causing possible internal organ damage and complications for diabetics (according to doctors)
om/health/a1c-test/my0
for people without diabetes, the normal range for the hemoglobin a1c test is between 4% and 5.6%
hemoglobin a1c levels between 5.7% and 6.4% indicate increased risk of diabetes, and levels of 6.5% or higher indicate diabetes
because studies have repeatedly shown that out-of-control diabetes results in complications from the disease, the goal for people with diabetes is a hemoglobin a1c less than 7%
prolonged a1c over 7.0 can begin causing possible internal organ damage and complications for diabetics
i feel my very very best at an a1c of 7
i starved myself into an a1c of 5.5 once, and landed in the hospital
anne i usually stress about this, but my a1c has been at 6.6 since diagnosed
this what my doctor would like me to be at i have kept most of my a1c'  in the 5 range and only one 6.2 and i was dx in june of 2008
the benefits of measuring a1c is that is gives a more reasonable view of what's happening over the course of time (3 months), and the value does not bounce as much as finger stick blood sugar measurements
as far as what one's physician says about a1c, it would tend to be whatever authority that dr chooses to follow: "the american diabetes association currently recommends an a1c goal of less than 7.0%, while other groups such as the american association of clinical endocrinologists recommend a goal of less than 6.5%
i have been using it and my a1c has gone from 11 to 6.2
a1c is the average of your bloodsugar/ bg readings over a 2-3 month period
the a1c # you will be trying to achieve should ideally be somewhere between 5.0 - 7.0 fiber definitely reduces blood sugar however 7.0 is high for a1c i started at 7.6 and now have been consistent between 5.9 and 6.3 and still require daily testing and oral medication fiber definitely reduces blood sugar however 7.0 is high for a1c i started at 7.6 and now have been consistent between 5.9 and 6.3 and still require daily testing and oral medication fiber definitely reduces blood sugar however 7.0 is high for a1c i started at 7.6 and now have been consistent between 5.9 and 6.3 and still require daily testing and oral medication fiber definitely reduces blood sugar however 7.0 is high for a1c i started at 7.6 and now have been consistent between 5.9 and 6.3 and still require daily testing and oral medication fiber definitely reduces blood sugar however 7.0 is high for a1c i started at 7.6 and now have been consistent between 5.9 and 6.3 and still require daily testing and oral medication fiber definitely reduces blood sugar however 7.0 is high for a1c i started at 7.6 and now have been consistent between 5.9 and 6.3 and still require daily testing and oral medication fiber definitely reduces blood sugar however 7.0 is high for a1c i started at 7.6 and now have been consistent between 5.9 and 6.3 and still require daily testing and oral medication fiber definitely reduces blood sugar however 7.0 is high for a1c i started at 7.6 and now have been consistent between 5.9 and 6.3 and still require daily testing and oral medication fiber definitely reduces blood sugar however 7.0 is high for a1c i started at 7.6 and now have been consistent between 5.9 and 6.3 and still require daily testing and oral medication fiber definitely reduces blood sugar however 7.0 is high for a1c i started at 7.6 and now have been consistent between 5.9 and 6.3 and still require daily testing and oral medication okra taste like you know what
my a1c hovers around 6 with no meds and i still use a small amount of sugar in my diet
i realize that my situation is fairly unique but the only time my a1c has been up is when i was recovering serious surgery and then it was still under 7
my a1c went from 6.5 to 5.7 and has stayed there
my a1c has been beaten down to 5
i try to keep tight control, last a1c was 5.8
because of that (and i knew this would happen), my a1c jumped from 5.5 to 6.4
best case - your hba1c is less than 7, you have no complications from diabetes, your blood pressure and cholesterol are controlled
tml english ok as you know i'm new at this so here goes my wife is border line diabetic her a1c is usually in the sixes she is also a nurse so after being told last tuesday i was diabetic i started trying to eat right i eat 3 times a day and have a few snacks in between have cut down my meals a lot from the past trying to eat low carb
my a1c has gone down from 10.9 to 7.9 so i'm excited to see improvement
at that time my a1c was extremely high as were my daily blood glucose readings (a1c 20.5 blood glucose at the er 570 mg/dl) for the past 3 years i have been maintaining a1c between 5.0 and 5.6 and that is without meds
my a1c has been under 5.6 for 3 years
and what does 6.0 mean my last a1c (3 months ago) was 5.9
normal a1c's would be in the mid 4's to low 5's
tml english hello all would like your views on this   i was diagnosed as type 2 diabetic two months ago with an a1c of above 12
now my doctor tells me i am (1) considered a non- diabetic; (2) that my a1c is 5.1; (3) i no longer need insulin shots; and (4) i only take metformin 500mg
my first a1c was about 5.7, my second was 5.4, third was 5.4 and  last one was 5.2 but the glucose tolerance test told that i do indeed have diabetes, numbers were high throughout
my a1c, which was at 13.2 is down to 4.7 (i spelled it out in the title so i could emphasize it, and to make everyone aware that this was no typo
i would love a a1c of 4.9
my a1c's were taken in the mid 1980's and they gradually improved
i think i may have had a1c's in the 7's at that time
my a1c's were in the 6's and still improving
many of you already know that my current weight loss is 40 pounds, and that my a1c has now dropped to 5.7
my numbers are also in the same range as yours and am hoping my next a1c will be under 6 and my diabetes will no longer classed as uncontrolled
i am not going to sweat it&hellip;don't expect perfection from yourself&hellip;it will drive you nuts&hellip;i am speaking from experience&hellip;take a big deep breath and look at the big picture&hellip;40 pounds gone and an a1c of 5.7&hellip;that is fantastic&hellip;never stop trying to improve&hellip;but realize that even in your imperfection you are doing an amazing job
i would give anything to get my a1c below 6 and if i woke up in the morning with numbers in the low 100's, i would be doing a dance
my latest a1c was 5.2 (just last week)  my average bg is 110
in may of 2013, my a1c was 8.1, then this past august, it was 7, now i am at 6.1
for example, my a1c level was 8.7, what does that mean my average was over the past three months
:) danni 8.7 a1c would put you around a 230 average   good luck with the pink&hellip;love it
about a year ago my a1c came in at 9.2
my last a1c was 10.4 so my dr is really playing with my dosages now
my a1c was 14.5 at that time average 3 month sugar of 500+
after being trained correctly my a1c was at 10.2 in march and in july 6.3 it is great and if you are taking alot of insulin shots a day you might want to check into it it has been a life saver for me contact me if you have any questions i just wish i would have done this years ago and maybe i would not have all the extra problems i have now i am on the same boat with you i was also diagnosed in 1995 at 21 and was put on one form of medication or diet until i was placed on insulin and was told to take 7 shots a day
my a1c was 14.5 at that time average 3 month sugar of 500+
after being trained correctly my a1c was at 10.2 in march and in july 6.3 it is great and if you are taking alot of insulin shots a day you might want to check into it it has been a life saver for me contact me if you have any questions i just wish i would have done this years ago and maybe i would not have all the extra problems i have now boy, i know exactly how you feel - and i'll take your sharing as an opportunity to express my history and feelings:   i'm 55 years old, and my 50th birthday present was to start injecting insulin (happy birthday, right
my recent a1c was 11.3 which i knew it was right around there but the nurse went over my test results for the other labs they ran in december
my last a1c was 6.7
my a1c three month ago was 6.5
my a1c is all the way up to 9.2
in fall 2010 look for the following:   new diabetic diagnostic criteria&hellip; the american diabetes association announced new guidelines for diagnosis of diabetes including an a1c greater than or equal to 6.5%
my a1c has held 5.5-5.9 for all two years
my a1c is at 8% and i have lows at least 3 times a week
but my a1c went up to 6.8 from 6.4
with all the self testing i have been doing at home, i was expecting my a1c to be 6.1 so 6.8 was a big surprise and disappointment to say the least
i see him again in 3 months and after that, if my a1c is below 6.5 he will put me on a 6 month schedule
i was just given a 6.4 a1c down from 6.8
i did this in conjunction with a meal plan where i stopped my dependance on diabetes meds, lowered my blood glucose (bg) readings to nearly normal, had an a1c of 5.5 lost 65 lbs (over a year's time), and lowered my insulin resistance
i am trying to bring my a1c from 8.9
ever since i've stopped using them, i've had less headaches, sugar cravings, and my blood sugars balanced out dramatically (a1c went from 8.5 to 5.5 since)
the ultimate arbiter is to make sure you're a1c is no higher than the 6's
my a1c was over 10 and is now down to 6.4
when i went to my last appt at the beginning of may my a1c went from 13.5 to 11
you have to be considered a controlled diabetic, although that isn't really defined i would imagine it means an a1c 7 or under
i am a bit over weight and my cholesterol is borderline and my type 2 is well controlled  ( past two a1c 4.8 &amp; 5 ) so i try to stay off cheese
a1c down 2 months ago
my bg was 377, my a1c was 14, my total cholesterol was 232, and my white blood cell count was off the charts
today, my a1c is 7.1, my total cholesterol is 194(without meds
i've been working hard at control since my "re"commitment to control after an a1c of 16&hellip;i don't get retested until the week before christmas so it'll be a challenge
tml english hey got test back a1c ,they were up 3 points, i have very stressful job, gotr to excercise more so when i go back in october, hope to be back on track, pray for me and wish me luck, any more suggestions, have great day i am sorry that it went up for you, but life is funny that way and any number of things could affect those levels
tml english had a1c done and it was 7.0
i was diagnosed after losing 40 pounds and came into the er with a1c of 15.7, currently have it down to 5.7
the good news, for me, is that my a1c was a 7 this time, down .2 since three months ago when i had it taken
when they take my a1c, i get the results in about 15 minutes&hellip; i am wondering, do most folks have to wait for their results normally, or is mine a fluke that they can give me the a1c test results so quickly
i was just informed that my a1c was 6.2
my a1c is 6.4
19097-diagnosed-5-21-13-a1c-7-4-fasting-glucose-is-123-diet-and-exercise-enough-meter-needed-yet
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
all my numbers from the blood work came back great, my a1c was a 6.7 which the dr really liked
mt last a1c was 6.9 which i am not happy with
why are you not happy with your last a1c at 6.9
i am an amputee so my exercise is limited, but i have found things that work for me and am able to maintain an a1c of 6.1 to 6.6
my a1c was over 8 and my bg was around 300
i managed to bring my a1c down to 5.9 or so as of last june
i also got my a1c down to 5.5 and i lost 65 lbs in about 5 mo
bringing your a1c to a 5.9
my a1c was 6.2 in jan &amp; 5.8 as of 3weeks ago
i have only be diabetic for 10 months, but this last a1c was up a full point, after being down 4.1 points from initial diagnosis three months ago
a1c was 5.8 and last reading was 5.3
i  am always looking for ways to better my bg control ever since i got diagnosed as type 2 last year with a bg level of 650 and a1c of 14.2
my a1c was 13.3
have been shooting for 46 years&hellip;no problem with a1c (6.5), but have been reluctant to change
pros: my a1c has dropped from 7 to 5.9 almost immediately
my last a1c was 10.4
so, the a1c is really the best way to see what is happening with your bgs over a 3 month period
your a1c is not good and you should try to get it below 6
unless you are in a special situation, to take your a1c more frequently than every 3 mos is wasting money
a1c is shorthand we use for a "glycosilated hemoglobin a1c" test
an a1c averages your blood glucose (bg) readings over the past 3 month period
(a person whose pancreas works normally has an a1c of 4 to 5.7)
enjoy it, and remember your a1c is an average of 3 months
as a result, i've limited my carb intake and have been able to get my a1c back to 6.7
have been type 2 for over 10 years, and have a1c of 5.6
my a1c has never exceeded 7 for the last 8yrs
my a1c's are typically 8-10 :/ please share with me your secret to controlling your sugar, diet, etc
i'd been really good, and my a1c had come back again as 6.2 (same as it was in december, which is good i'm holding steady) and two were stuck together so she made me take both lol
two years of a1c's at 5.3 or 5.4 and i know my approach works for me
when i got my first a1c in june it was 6.4 and the doctor was happy
very grateful, annette a normal a1c is roughly in the 4.3-5.4% range
kd, one endo i met put the normal a1c at under 6.0, my doctor, who is not a diabetic said her a1c is 5.5
my latest a1c came in at 5.3, varied from 5.1 to 5.5 over the year&hellip;why do you put the high range at 5.4
edit:  that said, if you have diabetes and have an a1c that is under 5.5 it doesn't mean you are no longer diabetic
tml english as an update i was diagnosed w/ type 2 diabetes in early june, see my blood work progress below:   june results (changed diet and exercise before august appt) a1c 11.6 tri 248 hdl 28 total cho 262   august results (diet, exercise and 500 mg of metformin er to lower my a1c before december blood work) a1c 6.8 tri 92 hdl 41 total cho 149   december results (maintain same for february test) a1c 6.4 tri 93 hdl 39 total cho 151   overall have lost over 25 pounds, i am 6'0" and now weight in at a whopping 162, doc says lets not lose to much more
i was recently told by an endo that if we keep our bg level normal like non-diabetic (a1c under 6), our chance of developing complications is no higher than that of a non-diabetics
my a1c was also 6.5
my a1c stayed at a consistent 6.0 and my total cholesterol was 160
tml english i went to the diabeties center yesterday and i was wondering what peoples a1c is mine was 7.8 and they had to double the amount of insullin im on and that concerns me a real lot
quick update to my post below - i saw my doctor today and got my a1c from the blood draw taken monday - i am down from 12.46 in january to 5.78 this week
i just had my followup and my new a1c is 6.7
my last a1c was 7.1 in march, down from 7.2 in january and 7.5 last september  it's still too high for my liking
my last a1c was 5.8
i just had a a1c check this month and it is 6.1
i was just diagnosed with diabetes in january of this year and at that time my a1c was 11.1
quite a difference from my original 12.5 last may when i was diagnosed&hellip; my last a1c was 8.7&hellip;but i had been sick with asthma before hand and it is starting to come down&hellip;it was 9.3
my a1c from before was over 9 but that was when i was sick and had to have  fempop surgery done on both legs for p
and then had a heart attack and had to have double bypass open heart surgery, i am a good example of what can happen if you do not keep you blood suger normal, and if you do not take your medicine  like you should or take care of yourself, i am only 47 and my health sucks, i did not take care of myself, and i have suffered because of it, i could not afford my medicine, i could not afford to go to dr, then i moved and found a clinic that goes on your income, on how much you pay the dr, and they really helped get my meds, then i got married and my husband put me on his health insurance my last a1c level was 7.2 and my dr put me on a symlin pen  120, you take the shot with your meals
hey also have an emergency glucose shot that the dr can subscribe for you but it is really expensive my last a1c was 6.5 which is high for me
have a great weekend, nancy my last a1c which was last month was 6.0
my a1c was 14
hang in there when i was diagnosed in december, my a1c was 12.4 now it is 6.0 many of us start with high numbers like that when we are first diagnosed
my a1c was tested yesterday at 7.5, down from 8.2 a couple of months ago
about 1 week ago it was 5.7 up a little from 5.2  alan my last a1c is 6, down from three months ago&hellip;dr and i very happy
my last a1c1 level was 6.2, a couple of years ago it was 9
my last a1c was 6.3 &hellip;my dr seems to be ok with that&hellip;i'm usually able to keep it around 6 never under tho
well, the doctor can&#39;t be right about &quot;everything&quot; lol i went to the doctor on monday and my a1c was 6.5
an a1c of 7.8 leaves room for improvement and if you were not comfortable with what your doctor changed your dose to, you need to talk to  him and express your concerns
my last a1c 6.1
my last a1c was 6.5,
tml english gave myself an a1c this morning and it's 5.8&mdash;same as the results of 4/22/13
original a1c in june 2012 was 7.5
my hba1c was 5.2, non-fasting blood sugar was 93, but insulin was 44
i have been able to maintain my weight around 120 lbs and my last a1c was 6.6
he/she can make sure your a1c is on track   even though i am not on insulin i agree with kim 2 carbs per day on insulin simply doesn't sound right
i had acheived an a1c of 5.5%, and had lost 65 lbs over a 5 mo period
my first a1c test was 14.1 and my first fasting blood sugar was 366
my next a1c went to 5.9
all my a1c for the last 2 years have remained below 6
swtch to united health insurance they are helpful when it comes to any &amp; all diabetic needs ive been with them for several years &amp; they have had any issues plus i wear the insulin pump and the dexcom g4 cgm continuious  glucose moniter my a1c, are usualy in the mid 6 range,best regards steve crawford
my last a1c was 6.9  are you on medicare
hello that's a pretty good number &amp; good self  control if you can maintain an an a1c in the sixes the cgm is not always right on but if you don't eat or do anything out of your daily normal exersice or carbs it does give a certain sence of additional control but can be off by 50 to  100 against a finger stick  but i have compared glucose meters  &amp; they can differ by quite a margin i recommend contour by bayer i personally am required to use the one touch verio there meter is almost exactly the same as my drs actual  blood drawn from the vein
my last a1c was 5.2 which i never thought i'd reach lol
it didn't my a1c test has been over 10.3 for the last couple of years
top that off with stress from the wanna be husband and other things i wonder why my a1c is up to 9.4
of course, with my current a1c of 4.7 nobody with half an ounce of brains would suggest i ought to use insulin
if you might happen to be t 2, you may negotiate with the new dr about being on insulin (i was on small doses of nph twice a day and then was able to drop it when my a1c got to about 5.5%)   god's best to you james howdy sonic how are you trying to control your bg (blood glucose) levels now, which oral meds
i went from blood sugars averaging 200+ with an a1c of 8.9 to now average blood sugars of 80 to 90 with an a1c of 4.2
someone here told me that if your hba1c is below 5.5 for 5 years, only then you are allowed to see the profile with your inner eye

my a1c went from 7.8 to 6.4
i see i can do better i had blood work recently and my a1c was 7.7 i spoke with a friend with type 2 yesterday that told me his sugar levels are very low after he started taking cinnamon pills sold over the counter- his friend also started taking them and was able to get off medication
last a1c was 5.5, so as long as i can keep it under 6, i'll be happy
my a1c level that caused me to be diagnosed with diabetes was 6.6, which, according to this chart is an a
when first diagnosed with type 2 my a1c was 14.5
throug it all my a1c after the first six months has ranged from 6.1 where i am now to a hogh of 7.3 when i started needing meds
described the a1c as an onion&hellip; you know an onion has layers of skin&hellip; the higher the a1c, the "thicker" the onion, i
good question &hellip;   if somebody does not change their eating habits &hellip; the onion would stay the same or possibly even get more layers of skin &hellip;   this still isn't a problem (a deception) because some medication is even designed to "trick" the pancreas into "working" &hellip; :)   still &hellip; what is this doing to the "onion" &hellip;   now &hellip; back to you &hellip; your a1c was 13 back in september of 2014, i would imagine&hellip;   if you start eating right, i
reversing diabetes, is to stick with eating right&hellip; and over time &hellip; more and more layers start to come off the "onion" until you get to the point to where your pancreas wakes up again because it can penetrate the "onion" &hellip; :)   i was a 13, and in a matter of a year, i dropped down to 4.2 &hellip; and i did this by completely cutting out sodas (diet also), and any kind of processed food i could imagine&hellip; i stuck to foods that were low on the glycemic index&hellip; i thrived on raspberries, strawberries, cantaloup, spinach, broccoli, kale, cauliflower &hellip; i dropped almost every starchy vegetable &hellip; potatoes, corn, carrots, etc&hellip;   all of my bloodwork, now, is where it should be&hellip; and this is what my goal was&hellip; and i was able to reverse it&hellip;   some will say "remission" &hellip; i don't agree with this at all&hellip; because, the collection of symptoms i have have gone away&hellip; no more&hellip; including my a1c&hellip;   it is very possible&hellip; but &hellip; the diabetic is the one who must make the choice&hellip; type 2 diabetic, that is&hellip; type 1 is a whole nother ball game&hellip;   any ways &hellip; that's a lot &hellip; congratulations, again&hellip; keep at it&hellip; how are you doing these days&hellip; since roughly 3 months have passed since your post
i had an a1c of 8 and decided for a 3 month period i would cut way back on carbs and dairy
interesting chart, i'm going to talk to my doctor about all my a1c's my last a1c was 5.9 which is very good according to your chart
it seems the latest is that a a1c of 6.5 to 7.0 is being treated with diet, exercise and sometimes depending on other health problems, metformin
today, my a1c is 5.4 and has been around that , never more than 6.0 for 4 years or better
my current a1c is a 6 so i am an at
my blood test showed my a1c as 6.6% and my fasting blood sugar at 129
i was diagnosed in february of 2010 with type 2 diabetes, my blood sugar was 379 and a1c 11.6
started with an a1c of 14.1 and have been able to keep it below 6 ever since
oops &hellip; thanks &hellip; corrected the error if you rely on the "diabetes establishment" you will get very basic nutritional info and if you take your meds and follow their advice you will probably achieve and maintain their a1c goal of 7.0 (or less)
now i've been maintaining my bg numbers at or close to the "normal" range, and my a1c is 5.5, when i could only get as low as 6.2 before
would keep a1c levels between 6 and 7 with no other input
jim i would be delighted with an a1c between 6 &amp; 7, instead of between 9 &amp; 10
may a1c was 5.5 i have lost about 50 lbs since feb
but my a1c's (a test that gauges how well blood sugars are controlled) are in the high 6's&hellip;not bad, but i'd like to get them into the low/mid 6's, so, for me that means probably eating even fewer carbs and/or exercising more
certainly a lower a1c is one way, but i have been stuck between 6.1 and 5.7 for over 7 years so, although i still want to lower my a1c, i look to other "numbers" to validate my efforts
y/1k1beos ) in the hopes that they would help improve insulin sensitivity &hellip; were i to wait the 4 more months until my next a1c to figure out if it was helping i could do more damage than potential good, so i am making an effort to save up my strips so i can test my postprandial numbers (it appears to be helping quite a bit)   steve i watch my fasting and 2 hour post meal glucose levels very closely as well as a1c
between february and may i lost 5 pounds and my a1c went down to 6.2
my a1c went down to 6.1
when i was lighter my a1c was a lot higher, believe it or not&hellip;i need to lose 50lbs, and i think you are doing really good
tuesday went to endo for 3 month check up a1c 6.6 i just can't seem to bring it lower than this
and also some kinda scholarship for kids who keep their hba1c under 7&hellip; something of such sorts to boost the kids
i have lost alot of weight and now my a1c is down to 5.5
i have been able to maintain my weight around 120 lbs and my hba1c in the 6's
does not seem to think my a1c is all that high last a1c was 6.2
my a1c is good though 5.4 was the last 3 months ago
tml english my son that's 4 was diagnosed with type 1b about 3 months ago he was put on insulin at first but taking off shortly because he kept running too low when we started out he had a yeast infection and an infection in his finger because he sucks on his fingers he is also epileptic and takes keppra for that when we went into the doctor for the infection i told him that he was peeing a lot and he always wanted something to drink it was the start of summer vacation so i thought it was just because he was outside all the time and its hot and i remember that he was also getting more sweets and drinking milk and eating a lot more ice cream he really didn't do too much dairy before this summer so the doctor check for ketones and he had ketone he then checked his sugar it was at 230 they sent us to the hospital to get blood work then right back to the doctors office they put him on insulin and said that his a1c was 11 we done that for a few days we went back to see the doctor and we decided that we wanted to go to cincinnati children's there's a recheck is a 1 c it was still 11 we were there for 4 days learning how to do everything got more blood work done went back about a week and a half two weeks later his a1c was down 8.6 and they noticed that his sugar was still going low after taking him off his long lasting and putting him way down on his after meal so they ended up taking him completely off he has been off of insulin for about 2 months now his blood sugars run great his morning fasting is anywhere from 65 to 85 thes after meals are always back to normal by 3 hours he just went back to the doctor just last week and his a1c was down to 6.7 and they done a peptide and the doctor said he was normal his fasting was 81 his c peptide was 0.4 and his insulin was 1.1 i'm not really sure how that's read but she said please somebody help me understand this stuff howdy kimberly welcome to dc
my a1c is 5.9%, my hypos are almost non-existant &mdash; haven't had a major one in over two years &mdash; i'm losing weight for the first time ever, and my retinopathay has been halted in its tracks
my a1c was "off the chart" at 15+, my glucose was high 300's at first, but currently 126-140 and still going down, and i'm on metformin
i was diagnosed 2 weeks ago&mdash;a1c 7.9, bs 450 after meals
:) my a1c is near 6.7 but i'm targeting a 6.5 to 6
i have just come back taking care of myself so my numbers are just from june 21/2015 a1c 11.4 - my bs average was 289 - since then it has been a really up and down - lowest 90 and highest 160 and everything in between - i am on metformim 1000mg er bid and alpha lipoic acid with evening primrose oil 3x day - i am staying away from lantus for now and seeing what will happens
hi karmannghiachristy, when first diagnosed &hellip; my a1c was 13.5, my glucose was 400
now my latest a1c was 5.5; my glucose is between 90's and 110
my a1c is now 4.9&hellip;it has been 11 mos since diagnosis&hellip;it took me about a month to figure out for the most part that i had to eliminate all high carb foods
10.0 at  d'x (2007) &hellip; 3 months later 6.6 &hellip; at or below 6.1 ever since &hellip; 5.7 last a1c (may) i rarely check my blood anymore &hellip; but for you i just did &hellip; 11 pm, 2 hours after dinner, it was 89
there arent many options in my area for diabetes drs that take my insurance feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
although i don't know if they would ask for proof, they will ask if your diabetes is well controlled which means (for the most part) they will want an a1c under 7
donating blood artificially lowers your a1c which basically makes the a1c test useless as a doctor shouldn't use the result for anything
basically that means that although you may get a lower a1c, you will not see any benefit to it so it would be as if your a1c was higher
she doesn&#39;t eat that great, but her a1c&#39;s are always in the low 6&#39;s upper 5&#39;s
nope, your a1c doesn&#39;t matter to the blood center
now, my a1c went from 12 to 7.2 - not where i want but better - (taking only metformim, alpha lipoic acid with biotin and evening primrose oil) no lantus
i finally got my result for  hba1c - (4.5 %)
ive never been more motivated to taking care of my diabetes until the doctor approved me for a pump so my hba1c has dropped from 14 to 8.4 over the period of 5 months
my next a1c should be way lower than 7.0 this time
my may 2011 a1c was 5.5 and i have lost about 50 lbs while keeping my bg levels in the normal range
my last a1c was 8.7
my bg's run in the 6-7range for a1c for 25 years
a1c was 5.6 and bs was 84
tml english ok a1c is 7.1 down from 13.4 so getting there but recently as i have mentioned in previous post was wearing bg monitor will know results in couple weeks but with a1c at 7.1 average bg readings multiple times daily of 300 doesn't make sense to anybody has anyone else experienced this situation thank you everyone yes endo called today said low a1c was probably caused by meds taken and from surgerys i've had or from the infection i had but the meds i have been on raise my bg so i asked her how that could be and she said with everything in combination and last a1c done after last surgery basically right now it was a dirty a1c reading until i'm over my problems won't be correct bg monitor i wore last weak still pending but good news is will be going on pump next month yeah that should help a lot she says so i'm looking forward to it you must have had plenty of low bg during the day
you a1c is more like an average, although that is a very simply way to explain the a1c
yet one of those times when she was having an episode like that her a1c was shown to be in the low 6s
it was puzzling until someone pointed out that an a1c is an average of one's bgs for 24 hrs a day for 90 days
her a1c in the 6s made sense to me when explained that way
after my bloodwork my a1c was low and my insurance wouldn't pay for it&hellip;debe i to have the minimed 722 with the cgm and love it i have had aa medtronic paradigm 722 since last september
also, as a type 1, aiming for an a1c in the 6's is fine, which translates into a bg range of 80-180
by doing this, i've been able to maintain my weight at 120 lbs and get my a1c back into the 6's
last year, i was diagnosed early, my a1c was 5.6 and i was 25 lbs, overweight
is your diet good but i had same problem i was taking over 400 units a day of 2 types of insulin my endo put me on pump and after a month i was using 1 insulin and 150 units every three days and now i stay around 100 - 140 a1c dropped 6 points and i feel great
it's been 17 months since diagnosed&hellip;at first my life was literally turned up side down, my a1c was 11.7 at time of diagnostics and my glucose lever was totally out of control&hellip; just got some new results yesterday from my doctor and my a1c is now 5.7 and my overall glucose level is 126&hellip; the key for me it has been diet and exercise although i recently had to go back on metformin at 500 mg but i'll be doing 2 on and 1 off&hellip; my goal is to hopefully some day not too far away i can get off medicine and use diet and exercise alone
an a1c of 11.7 to a 5.7 is great
my a1c has been streadily climbing and so over the last 6 months have been watching my carbs and exercising a little more
my daily limit is 120 grams per day which allows me to maintain my weight between 120-123 lbs and my last hba1c was 6.9&hellip;room for improvement in the a1c but still under 7
s/he seems to be doing ok as a dr since he has taken your hemoglobin a1c test ("hba1c" or shortened to "a1c"), and wants to see what your average level of bg was for the past 3 mos
i have been able to maintain my a1c under 7.0 by allowing myself no more than 120 grams of carb per day
my a1c is 6.5
when diagnosed i was 14 and played soccer probably 5 times a week, and my a1c was usually around 6.1
the ada recommends the a1c to be under 7 so you're there
4772-a1c1
its all good&hellip;   peace   deb ps&hellip;also the original question about a1c acceptable reading&hellip;   for people without diabetes, the normal range for the hemoglobin a1c test is between 4% and 6%
because studies have repeatedly shown that out-of-control diabetes results in complications from the disease, the goal for people with diabetes is an hemoglobin a1c less than 6.8%
nelda read my discussion titled "you have to be your own analyst" it may help you gain control and reduce your a1c1
the tightest professional recommendation is to have your a1c under 6.5, the most lenient is under 7 so you are above both of those
7.7 is not ideal but with the right foods and carb intake and execrise ,portion size you can get lower numbers below 7.0 i have done this my last 3 a1c were 5.4
tml english i finally got the results of my bloodwork and my a1c is at 8.4 which is up again
then i guess i got older and  my a1c went up to 13.5
my a1c remained below 7.0% for 2 years, but recently hit 8.8% and i don't know why (except for tons of constant stress)
my a1c hit almost 12% before i asked my endo for insulin
now my a1c is staying between 5.6% and 5.9% consistently for the past 8-9 months, so i'm happy and feeling pretty good
a1c has remained below 6 since being diagnosed
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
i was told he considers an a1c of 7 to be acceptable
:)   "for someone who doesn't have diabetes, a normal a1c level can range from 4.5 to 6 percent
someone who's had uncontrolled diabetes for a long time might have an a1c level above 8 percent
web md hi bella,  an a1c of 7 is considered normal by the ada
the best a1c test i have ever had was 7.2 but usually are from 7.9-8.9
o now my dr said i can quit my meds,my a1c is down to 6&hellip;just keep on the diet and maby you can quit your meds also with your drs help
my a1c at the original time of diagnosis was 8%
my hemoglobin a1c went down to 5.5% and stayed there for several years
my a1c came back at an astounding 11%
my a1c was 11 the very first time they took it and my average glucose for the 3 month period was 260
better than when i was diagnosed, bs was 382 and hbga1c was 9.5%
it took a while for my tastes to change but ever since that time, and for at least three consecutive a1c's, i have been 5.4 or less
controlled, i am trying really hard to get my a1c to 5
while taking since august of 2010 i have decreased my a1c number from 10.8 to 5.7
-beerlilly forgot to add that my a1c has been running between 6 and 5.7 with the januiva, metformin
my a1c is a 6.4 who hooooooo
yes, 6.3 ha1c is an improvement over 6.6 but you need to shoot for a normal blood sugar which is 4.5 to 5.4
an ha1c of 6.3 is equivalent to a daily average blood sugar of somewhere around 150
talk to you soon, hugs, peggy well diabetes runs in my family  as well as high chlosetral heart disease and cancer&hellip;oh happy day  lol but knew something was up and probally was diabetic since my 30's but didnt get tested till i g et married&hellip;but good thing i did and now am trying to get healthy&hellip;diet going ok&hellip;trying to redirect eating junk to something health&hellip;lost half pound which is good thing&hellip;but still have long way to go yet&hellip;now have to figure why i eat when not hungry, or emotional eat&hellip;tough one but all good&hellip;cant fix it if dont know whats broke or have an idea&hellip;a1c was 6.2/3 which isnt bad but need to deal with diet again first&hellip;didnt put me on anything till asked to be put on metaformin&hellip;talk laters  sharon i am reminded of the song "i beg your pardon, i didn't promise a rose garden" sung by tammy wynette (among others) ~  http://www
oh yeah, my a1c is staying around 4 now
my a1c went from 14.1 to 5.9 in 4 months
my a1c was 5.4 or something but it has gone up&hellip;this past december 2013
friday i got bloodwork back from the dr, and my a1c was 6.5
oh and achieving an a1c of 5.5 and losing 65 lbs didn't hurt my feelings either
&hellip; the results of my last a1c came back as 5.9
my a1c use to be11
my ha1c had risen to 9.7 under the care of the last doctor
my ha1c went to 7.4 which is not where i want it to be
my last a1c was 5.9 the previous being 8
my last a1c level was 6.7 which pleased my doctor
i am on cholesterol medication, and my a1c three weeks ago was 5.8 a little high but i have been hospitalized back and forth since dec.29, 2014 so that's prednisone a medication for severe asthma
i am on cholesterol medication, and my a1c three weeks ago was 5.8 a little high but i have been hospitalized back and forth since dec.29, 2014 so that's prednisone a medication for severe asthma
at the time of diagnosis my levels from the a1c were 530+ @ 13.3
joseph,  with  a  b/s  level  of  a  range  between  103-110  is  outstanding,  oh  unless  you  weigh  50  lbs,  but  anyway  my  b/s  levels  always  range  anywhere  from  130- 160  and  my  a1c's  were  great  like  5.6  which  is  good,  so  don't  let  the  103-110  discourage  you  in  anyway
what ever works i was taking 120 lantus and about 80 to 100 of rapid insulin so over 200 units of insulin a day my a1c was 11.7 so doc decided to give victoza a chance with in 3 months i was at 7.3 a1c it has litterly saved my life im getting my life back together i dont have insurance  and was able to get company to provide meds at no cost so if you have money issues most companies have help on site most doctors will help but u must ask alott of docs wont offer this help unless u ask
my last a1c was 5.8 but i know it will be much higher this time
i'm type 2, and my diabetes has gotten progressively worse, my last a1c was 7.1
my a1c was 7.5
however, since then i've gone to diabetic education, taken my meftormin, watched my diet and exercise and my a1c last week was 6.1
when the diagnosis of diabetes came in, i was told that i had to postpone the operation until i could get my bg under control (a1c was 12.6)
when i went to see my pcp i was floored when he said my glucose was 440 and a1c was 14
2-1/2 months later, i got off the insulin; my glucose is usually around 110 - 120 and the last appt my a1c reading was 6.3

tml english my a1c is 7.00 is this safe or need to improve this reading pls suggest me at 7 the chances of complications drops off significantly, but they are still at a higher rate than the normal population
the studies that show what a really normal a1c is give the range 4.6-5.4
om/health/a1c-test/my0
including a chart that equates a 7.0 a1c to an approximate average of 150 mg/dl
a normal or well-controlled a1c is usually considered to range from 4.5 to 6 percent
my a1c 5.5
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
that, along with my basal and bolus insulins, resulted in my having a1c's below 6.0 soon after the start of the new century
my a1c's before the mid 1990s were much much higher
better yet, a1c has gone from 7.8 to 5.6
my a1c read 7.2
i went to the endocrine yesterday and my a1c was 11.1
if a fraction of that energy had been put into her health, she wouldn't have an a1c of 11+
we worked it out and my a1c was consistently under 7.0
cholesterol 157 total blood pressure 124/80 hdl 50 ldl 100 triglycerides 33 latest a1c is 6.3
blood pressure 120/60 cholesterol 236 ldl 163 triglycerides 207 a1c 5.7 that is wonderful news
my cortisol levels are also high, but she is hoping that is due to the fact that i have run high for so long (my a1c was 12.6)  my doctor told me that if the numbers don't go down in the next two weeks or so, that we're likely going to start insulin
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
suffice it to say, before metformin my a1c was normal for the last 4 times it was checked, which means one year&hellip; just on glyberide
saw my doctor on monday, glucose was 166,she said nothing is wrong because of the a1c only being at 5.7&hellip;i am now without a doctor to tell me if i am pre diabetic or diabetic
this is one of several reasons why i have maintained an a1c below 6.0 for so many years
i found an outstanding doctor at the same clinic about 3 months ago, and he said because everyday my blood sugar range is between 86 and 600, no such a thing as a type 2 that would have that everyday, however, my a1cs are too low for type 1 category he said
i had several low a1cs  in the doctor's offices, yet,  the last time i was in the emergency room, which was right after i got the results of a low a1c of 5.9 at the doctor's office, they ran another a1c test , and they said it was 16.0&mdash;-now, how can there be such a big difference in what the doctor's office finds, and the hospital
i just can't understand how one lab finds a huge a1c of 16 a few months ago ( the hospital lab&mdash;this hospital is outstanding&mdash;always has been) yet another lab only 1 day earlier found my a1c to be 5.9&hellip;good god&hellip;i mean, heck, now i know why russelstalemates gets confused
my a1c has always been under 7 and is currently 6.1
my last a1c was 7.4, down from 10.4, three months earlier, but&hellip;i was on about a 700 cal
my last a1c was 6.4
by going back to my earlier style of eating low gi carbs primarily, i am no longer overweight and have my bg under control with an a1c of 5.6
my a1c in december was 8.5 and in march was 5.8
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
my dr's nurse returned my call from fri&mdash;re a1c&mdash;it was 6
i am off them finally and going to have back surgery next week my sugars are back to "normal" my a1c dropped 2 points 2 weeks after  i was taken off them
tml english i made a mistake in my a1c i thought my doctor said it was 5.7 well today i went to the doctor with my wife, she was seeing  the doctor
and  my doctor said that he was going to chance my meds and i said why if my last a1c was 5.7 and he said no my last a1c was 5.2 so hooray for me and we will see what changes are in store for me for my meds
a normal human glucose/a1c or non diabetic a1c levels are 4.3 - 5.5 % (70 - 108 mg/dl)  congratulations on reaching a non diabetic a1c level
as long as your a1c is in the 6's or lower your morning bg is fine
those readings will give you an a1c in the 6's which is all you want inho:&gt;)
my a1c is between 5.4 and 5.6
my a1c was 7.0
for a long time my a1c test was a 5 but then i got under a lot of stress and pain etc and my #'s started creeping up
my last a1c test came back as a 5
my a1c was as low as 4.2 with a medication since taken off the market, but currently is not under control
i lost weight watching, and my a1c dropped to 6.0, and was taking off metformin, then i didn't care, guess what back on med's, so its not a diet, it's a way of living&hellip; excellent advice
my a1c has gone from 7 to 5.9 and i am slowly losing weight
good luck and congrats on bringing your a1c down below 6
tml english i've always felt good about my a1c,  i normally just walk to drop my numbers but lately with all the blueberries &amp; strawberries, i'm putting them in yogurt &amp; all kinds of thinks &amp; my sugars in in the 180's   i know fruit is very hard on my numbers but lately its a craving seeing every farm with a stand
your a1c number are in the very normal range except think the 4.9 may be considered low
my a1c was 14 and is now 8
my last   a1c was  6.5
she said she exercises everyday, monitors everything she eats and keeps her a1c at 5.0
if you get off of meds you will have to keep your a1c low that means between 5.0 and 5.1 and blood sugars between 80 an 100
at that time, my weight was 304.5 - my fasting bg was 388 and my a1c was 13.2 by june 1, 2016 (about 15 months after diagnosis) i will be below 200 pounds for the first time since high school, my fasting bg will be in at least the normal range of 70-110 (preferably below 90) and my a1c will be below 6.0  i will also be off all medication related to my diabetes (no metformin, no insulin) - i will also be at least significantly reduced on all my other medications, if not off them completely (i currently take 3 meds for bp and levothyroxine 175 mcg as well as omeprazole for gerd
already, i have dropped nearly forty pounds, i now walk 2 miles or more a day, every day, my last fasting sugar reading was 118, and my a1c was 9.2 - and that was a month ago&hellip;only two months after diagnosis (but also on 2000mg metformin daily)  i will update my new weight when i see my pcp on monday&hellip;and will also report how my little talk with him goes (i suspect he will be much easier to convince than my endo was)   but i won't have any lazy or greedy docors on my team
my a1c's are by no means perfect - 8.0, and on their way down, since i have removed diet sodas from my diet
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
my first a1c test in march 2014 read 7.4&hellip; my last one in jan
my a1c was 6.5 at diagnosis and is now 5.6
and if they continue to allow it to progress end up on insulin because of the effects it has on the body long term&hellip;   type 1's are different&hellip;they aren't producing enough, or any insulin&hellip;and its not typically about weight&hellip; and btw zimoss&hellip;while you would still be technically labeled "diabetic"&hellip;if you reduce your diabetes and a1c back to a good range with diet, weight loss, excersise, etc and come off all medication and are indeed in a point of "remission" although still technically diabetic&hellip;the point is&hellip;that state of remission is doing no damage to your body&hellip;   so as for type 1's with insulin control to reduce long term problems and other deseases   type 2's can do the same using weight, diet control&hellip;   that was the point&hellip;not the word cure&hellip; i'll have to bite my tongue here in an attempt to not let this thread get out of hand
tml english i went to see my internal medicine dr today and my a1c had been being 6.1, today it was 5.9
my sugar was 259 and they did an a1c that was 9.0
my sugar is 81 and my a1c is 6.0
i've been avoiding sugar for 40 years to keep a1c below 6, but it hides in many foods under a dozen aliases
a year ago he told me no potato salad, because that's apparently what was keeping my a1c 8.8  (it's 7.2 now)          so have any of you been told by your doctors not to eat a specific food
my a1c is 6.9 (i'm working to get it back into the mid 6's) and my triglycerides are in the 50's
lol) since i started on the no white diet, all of my labs including cholesterol, triglycerides, a1c, and all other labs that they took 9 vials of blood for last friday are all normal limits
last a1c was 5.3
my a1c was 7.4 last friday and my doctor is happy with that
i now have medical insurance and have started seeing a doctor regularly, and am terrified&hellip;my test results came back with an a1c of 11.4, cholesterol of 242, and triglicerydes (sp
21014-a1c-score---last-week-was-6-1-and-before-that-7-yet-i-got-a-letter-praising-me-for-my-control
my a1c is at 11% i feel so bad&hellip; like someone said, it can differ with different circumstances and health
an a1c of 7 is the minimum goal for most doctors and their diabetic patients
my a1c is6
my first two months i managed to cut my bs from over 200 to 94 i think it was&hellip;brought my a1c from 7.8 to 7.1 (i think&hellip;i am old and am trying to remember my numbers now)&hellip;i did this just by swimming, eating simple and right and taking my med each day
my a1c's are up to 7.8 when they usually are at 6.7
my a1c went from 11.6 to 5.7 in 3 months
now i have to call the doctor twice a week to adjust insulin and still have an a1c of 8
it's helped me keep my a1c under 6.5 since i got out of the hospital
one study i read showed that within a week, with no other changes to diet or exercise all medications were dropped, fasting blood sugars on average dropped 55 points and within 90 days the average a1c dropped by almost 3%
a study of 48,000 diabetics showed that a1cs lower than 7.0 led to an increased amount of death due to a cardiovascular incident
doing a1c in 1 mo
tml english hi everyone, i just got my 2nd a1c done (first one from diagnosed) and it is &hellip;5.4
tml english for the last three months been struggling with the effects of getting cellulitus which affected my a1c which in june was 6.8, then in sept and in the hospital was 7.4, and today at a new doc's office was 8
tml english hurray &mdash; i got my lab work results the other day &mdash;a1c was 6.8 &mdash; down from 8
to 7.0 to the 6.8 &mdash; of course that is good from where it was but i am not satisfied &mdash; i want to get it down closer to 6.0 thank u &mdash; i remember having it at 5,9 yrs ago &mdash; but that was a long time ago &mdash; when the docs raised a1c to 7.0 and under
what i was told it is bec most of us feel better and feel less tired with a1c under 7.0== pretty lame i thought &mdash; wreck your kidneys and your eyes to have more energy &mdash;- duh
i keep my bgs at or close to the "normal" range for bg readings and have an a1c of 5.5
i'm type 2 and my endo told me to check once a day since last a1c was 13.4 if i have a postive test i have to check everytime i go after 2 days of postive tests she has me go to her office and she does blood and urine tests
in the three registries, females, ethnic minorities, and those with above-target hba1c levels were at particularly increased risk for dka among patients, all of whom who had type 1 diabetes for at least a year
my last a1c was 6.8
i have developed a meal plan which i continue to follow ever since 02/2011 where i lost 65 lbs over 5 mos, was able to discontinue a small dose of insulin twice a day, and normalize (80 -130 mg/dl) blood glucose (bg) levels and have an a1c of 5.5
i thought i was lucky until two days ago; i had no complications, my last a1c was 6.7 and all was right in this world
not fun,, my doc rx lasix twice  day,, that helped, the fluid was drowning me,,  trying to keep my a1c's below 5.2 welcome linda
a1c of 5.2
her a1c came back at 11.9,  she is on humalog and levemir
i attack because when i do good no one understands and says that it would have been better if i had done this&hellip; and i get real depressed with my family cuz they just dont seem to listen to anything i say&hellip; a couple of test back my a1c results were 5.7 and i was so proud and my boyfriend said if i wouldnt cheat sometimes it would have been better and i was like this is the best i have ever been in 7 years&hellip; very sad and depressed&hellip; your a1c is fantastic and i for one, am very proud of you
tml english got the bad news in dec from doc a1c is 8.3 i didn't have a clue what that meant or what to do
for "typical" contro (vs tighter or looser control) the hba1c should be 6 to 7 %;  pre-meal targets should be 70 to 160 mg/dl or 3.9 to 8.9 mmol; one-hour post-meal target should be less than 180 mg/dl or 10.0 mmol
even though my a1c has not gone down she lowered my dosage because of my trouble tolerating the full 2000mg dose
she is happy with my a1c level of 6.4 because my total glucose is 150 which is right where she wants it to be
i personally am looking for an a1c below 6 and my average glucose needs to be whatever produces that
i have worked with a nutritionist for a long time and for the last 7 years my  a1c has not been over 6.5 if you check out protein needed in grams per day, a couple pieces of bacon would supply that
i find i can get by with 120 carbs per day and keep my a1c in the low 6"s
dx'd in 1976, i resisted pumping insulin until 2011 when my a1c started climbing to the high 6's and into the 7's
a1c's always below 7
my office a1c came back a 7.4 so i felt confident that the reli on was a good test
my a1c is 6
first of all don't be so hard on yourself, your a1c is 6, i only wish i could say that,good for you
ot the best score in 3 years from my doctor on my a1c test it was a 6,was running a 9
just started bydureon after 10 months of byetta i love just one shot a week and less nausea the needle is bigger and mixing is something you have to get use to but going on my third shot this week and my numbers have been good just hope i keep the wieght loss going lost 94 pounds on byetta and my a1c went from 12.4 to 6.1 good numbers my friend
my a1c was 10.9 in march and my next one was 7.2 then 6.4&hellip;with this medicine and eating less and much better
just know that bs over 145 is doing harm to your eyes and other orgains best wishes harlen my endo said i'm not ready for a pump till i get my a1c below 7.5
a1c is usually determined by a prescribed blood test done at a lab every 3 - 6 months &hellip; your doctor should set that up
l/k41cxa your regular dr is not very helpful try to find an endocrinologist that specializes in diabetes take a diabetes and nutrition class usually offered thru your local hospital some are free some covered by ins but you need to ask questions and learn all you can to stay healthy  like for me my endo wants me between 80-120 bg for now we are working to get my a1c below 6 allot of people will give good advise here but you do need to get a specialist to help you along thank you, i have an appointment with a diatician on the 29th at my local hospital :) it's great that you're asking questions here and have an appointment with a dietitian
~lynn @glucerna oh also walking and exercising helps bring down bg levels as does water but walking really helps your a1c is a lab test they do sell a1c testers and they are pretty good but you really only need to check it every few months as long as your bg levels stay normal a1c follows best was to stay away from high bg levels is when eating read labels for carbs your dietician will let you know how many a meal you should have but to see yourself test before eating you should be under 120 bg then eat say 30 carbs for that meal test two hrs later should still be around 120 it's really all about the carbs in good carbs is everything that is sugar and that turns into sugar web md has a lot of videos to watch on type 2 and carbs and testing first- take a deep breathe and relax
tml english i was so happy today to receive my blood test results and find these results in 3 months:   fbs: 127  down from 250  a1c: 6.4   down from 11.3   last time there was sugar found in the urine and that is now negative too&hellip;yay
the a1c was 6.5 though my fbg was 98
if i do not get my next a1c down i will be put on medication and since severe type 2 diabetes (she was on both meds and insulin and still had trouble keeping it under control) was one of the reasons why my mom died at least 15 years before her time this has major meaning to me   also my late fiance david was a brittle type 1 diabetic from the age of 5 and he was only 37 when he died with failed kidneys on dialysis
and my a1c has been 6
i had asked her what her a1c was, her answer was 'doctor said all my blood test came back normal&hellip;' and it certainly doesn't get any more re-assuring than hearing that&hellip;   fast forward to 2 days ago, somehow the topic came up again, 'what is your a1c
when she did get them in order, the a1c results were 12/2007, 5.7; 12/2008 5.6; 12/2009 5.8
the dr insisted an a1c of 5.8 is non-diabetic and normal
one thing though, with an a1c of 5.0, i think you can fairly confidently rule out high blood sugars right now
the a1c of 5 was taken over 6 months ago and things have deff changed a lot since then
sure i had a low a1c but i was passing out with blood sugar in the 60s every single day at three o'clock and angry erratic behavior because my blood sugar was then rapidly swinging back up into the 175 range
my may a1c was 5.5 and my weight has lowered about 50 lbs
my a1c have been less then since 6.6%
i pray you even better a1cs in the future   james hi jayabee52,  if i remember i get in one test a day, but usually it is maybe once a week
when i went to my doctor she was so excited that my a1c was 7 but i had remember it was lower than that
a1c gives them a clue as to the average, but there are a lot of things that affect that and if you are not testing, you won&#39;t know what those things are
i've kept my a1c between 6.0 to 6.2 for close two 22 years
i feel that i am closing in on finally understanding what i need to do to achieve my goals (normal/ideal weight, a1c, blood pressure and cholesterol levels with as little medication as possible &hellip; a1c is the last to fall in place)
tml english when i was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in january, my blood sugar was 347 and my a1c was 11.7
in april my blood sugar readings were in the 90s and my a1c was 5.9
my latest blood sugar readings are in the 80s and 90s and my a1c is 5.0
i was diagnosed around aug 7th  with type one, my blood  sugar was 200 and my a1c was 8.2
my a1cs have all been in the 5 range, 5.7 and lower, but i have never been lower than 5.3 and i want to so bad
tml english my a1c has been consistent since my diagnosis in april 2011&hellip;4.5-4.6-4.4 and 4.5 2 were while on insulin the last two with diet only control
my last a1c in january this year was 6 and there has been no change in my diet
my a1c's crept into the 7's while i had been able to keep it in the 6's in the past
not sure what happened within those few monthst, but my first two a1c numbers were 13 and 12.5
the highest a1c of my last 5 was 5.1
a1c&hellip;is 5.4&hellip;doctor said my liver issue  has completely "corrected itself"&hellip;my liver couldn't possible be functioning any better
my a1c went from 8.1, the 7.3, this last time 6.7 i am getting there
my a1c is still 7,  but it doesn't seem to matter and it doesn't seem to matter if i am 76 years old and have had diabetes for 30 years
the doctor (endochronologist) says it might be a smarter, healthier, easier lifestyle for me and help get my a1c down from 12.5%
to accomplish this, low carb diet, exercise, and continual monitoring, a1c in the 6';s, etc
i have 3 important factors&hellip;1st is maintaining a healthy diet and low a1c to keep complications from occuring, 2nd is keeping my head above water financially ( to avoid stress) and 3rd is knocking my insulin resistance to the curb and losing the weight
my last a1c was 5.8 and that was when i had not been taking met
)   my doctor was very happy with me, and was totally on-board with my plans and goals&hellip;though he did warn me that a1c below 6.0 was going to be very hard to achieve - but not impossible&hellip;so he talked me into a goal of 6.5 on the a1c so that i would not get discouraged if i end up with a 6.1   he told me that i am a new breed of patient he is seeing more and more of lately&hellip;the ones who are taking aggressive control of their diabetes&hellip;he said this has been occurring over about the last five years&hellip;prior to that, folks just took their insulin and that was it
since an a1c is an average of your blood glucose numbers ("bg#s") if that 7.3 signifies a rather flat bg# with little variation up or down, that is fairly good
she had been having readings of about 250 to 300, yet her a1c was only 6.5
my eye doc said keeping the a1c below 6 wold prevent damage to the eyes from happening
when i was diagnosed in august of last year, my a1c was 14
last a1c was 5.5
just recently had my a1c done and it was 4.9 (last year it was 6.9)
it allows me to maintain my weight at 120 lbs (good for my 5' 3" frame) and my last a1c was 6.7, in a range that indicates good diabetes control
when i went to the emergency room my sugar level was 1147 and my a1c number was 11.3
tsh highly sensitive test $61.33 comprehensive metabolic test $35.32 lipid profile2 $53.81 hemoglobin a1c $40.75 albumin urine microalbu $67.41 creatinine urine $25.03 grand total&hellip;$283.65 now i realize these tests have to be done, but, is it any wonder people like me who don't have and can't get insurance give up on taking care of their diabetes
312.00 for the month hemoglobin a1c  74.00 lipid panel  115.00 one on 2/5 and one on 2/25 230.00 for the month  the priveledge of drawing my blood  23.00 for each visit so 46.00 for the month
my a1c is 6.9 but lately i have been feeling yucky
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
an a1c is a is a test showing a 2-3 month average of your blood sugar in percentage form - usually part of your bloodwork at doctor's visits after a certain age or if you have (or might be getting) diabetes
(pesky sugar alcohol though) i have a small portion and not on a daily basis and my last a1c was 5.4
when i was first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 12 years ago, my bg was 465 and my a1c was 12.4
i have not been on any diabetes meds for over 10 years, have a1c close to 6, and know i can do better than that with diet (only watching carb intake) and exercise (basically just walking more, and occasional swimming) alone
a1c has been as low as 5.2
best wishes harlen i've just been told this week that my a1cs have toppled over the threshhold, only 6.2, but still high enough that i have to make changes
prior to my learning that my a1cs had increased (used to be 5.7), i started having to take naps at work before i could drive home&hellip; talk about embarrassing&hellip; amen
my a1c level 3 months ago was at 11, i am now at&hellip;drum roll please&hellip;    7.9
in nov 2010 my a1c was 9.3, by feb 2011 it was 7.4
cutting soda out of my diet alone took my a1c from 6.5 to 5.7 which dropped me into the pre diabetic range, and hopefully now its lower than that
my a1c went from 6.5 to 5.7 just by changing my diet
well i have done that too i have type one and think i can get away with eating what ever i want then feel bad i have to get my sugar down but am not trying hard enough i hate to go to dr and get the a1c result 13 usualy i hope its better this time
my last a1c was 6.7  just this morning at the gas station on the way to work i bought a pastry and iced tea
my a1c consistently came back at 6.5, sometimes even 6.4
last november my a1c came back at 8.4
i have not had an a1c below 8.5 for a decade
my a1c has climbed back up some (5.9 in march)
your a1c is great any number below 7.0 for t2 is good
my a1c had increased .4 and no weight loss
the byetta is working lost almost 40 pounds and a1c went from 11.2 to 7.8
well every one has different side effects and i know a lot of people who if they over eat get nausea that is why you get the weight loss i have been on it for 10 months and have lost 90 pounds and lowered my a1c from 12.4 to 6.2 hi martin
i guess so&hellip; i've been type 1 for about 10 years my a1c is around 7 or 8 as my husband has been up until recently and he's been d for 35 yrs and got new pump combo and under better control and felt same as u
july 2014: hba1c = 9.9%, bmi = 34.3 (very similar results for last 9 years)
dec 2014: hba1c = 5.7%, bmi = 28.0   my doctor was extremely pleased with my progress and cut down some medications
my a1c's have always been around 6.0 on my pump and in june, i decided to take a pump break that lasted 3 months
lol&hellip; my next a1c was 5.9
now the ada has set a new standard for a1c of 7
i suspect that the reason they set the a1c at 7 is because it can be more easily achieved with less of their killer drugs
with lifestyle, and very low carbohydrate intake, an a1c of 7 can be safe, it has worked for me for over 20 years
in almost 8 years as a type 2 on metformin and a low carb / high fat diet with an a1c at or under 6.0 for almost 7 1/2 years now i have never seen a low below 78 (only under 80 twice) or a high over 184 (rarely over 140) i have tested as much as 8 times a day but lately only once or twice &hellip; so when do these "wildly swinging numbers" occur and why is it impossible to comprehend that a type 2 can actually maintain "normal" blood glucose levels without endangering their health
i suspect it may be safer to have a more steady blood sugar that may give you an a1c of 7 than wildly swinging blood sugar levels that give you a an a1c of 6  also keeping circulation and blood pressure healthy and staying off drugs may contribute as well
my last a1c was 9.5 it is now currently 7.7
my a1c's are always below 6
i eat way better than i use to and my first a1c was 10.4 and after my first three months my a1c was 6.2
its really helped- i've gone from an 11.3 to a 7.6 a1c in just 5 1/2 months :)   she also had me take diabetes education classes which to my surprise i actually did learn some useful info
last 3 month lab for a1c was 7.2
a1c doesn't measure blood sugar and home glucose meters don't test a1c
i controlled everything really well and my a1c went from 10.7 to 6.6 in seven months
my a1c in june was up to 7.7
gary my doctor took me off of insulin today and my a1c is down by .5
tml english back in october 2011 when i got diagnosed with being type 2 diabetic, they did a blood test and my a1c level was 15.7 and my blood sugar level was 695&hellip;   my doctor put me on metformin and junvia, since october i've lost 65 pounds and (since may of last year to now a total of 105 lbs
my doctor recently did a a1c test and my level came back at 5
i found a website that has charts converting your a1c % # to a blood glucose number and it shows a 5% a1c is good and 4.0 to 4.9 as optimal
very sad&hellip; thank you all for your replies, i really appreciate it&hellip; as far as i'm concerned, an a1c of 5 is perfect
tell that silly doctor to test his own self for his a1c&hellip; if it's lower than 5 he's low&hellip; :)   that would explain why he's wrong here&hellip; hehehe
looked for over an hour but could not find it, but awhile ago there was a post, i believe it was about pumps, that said that a 6.0 a1c was considered safer than a 5.0 reading as there is more of a chance of having lows when you are at the low end of the a1c scale
tom keep in mind that an a1c is an average of your blood sugar levels over a 6-8 week period
to have an a1c of 5 would generally imply they had a lot of 3.0-4.0 blood sugars to make up for all the after meal blood sugars of 11.0-15.0 (estimate)
just a thought&hellip; also something else that doctors (maybe not gp's) know but won't talk about is that the a1c test shouldn't be the only or reliable guideline because it can vary up to 3 points
i have experienced this myself - my father and i are both type 1 diabetics and he always has a lower a1c reading than i do (his -6.7 vs mine-8.9) even though i have better blood sugar control (less high and low extreme's)
blessings to you and yours   james here are the a1c references that appear on my lab reports: 4.1%-6.4%: non-diabetic children 1.5-18 years) 4.3%-6.0% non-diabetic adults 6.2%-7.0% diabetic well-controlled 7.0%-8.0% diabetic fair controlled &gt;8.0% diabetic poor control   i am at a loss as to why your doctor thinks that an a1c of 5 is unacceptable since it is a level for a normal, non-diabetic individual
my a1c in january was 6.4  now it's 7.1 my cholesterol was 209 in january
i had gotten my a1c down to 6.2 from 8.2 but it is creeping back up due to all the prednisone
last time i did this i got my a1c down to 5.8
tml english my a1c in two yrs are in excellent level ( 66&hellip;6.3&hellip;5.3&hellip;) my last is 6.5 (jan.10 )
so far my last a1c was 5.5 and i have maintained a "normal" level of bg readings
each time my a1c went down we also adjusted meds down, and i was seeing my pcp quarterly so i never went more than 4 months
my last a1c was 5.9 and i will not risk my life by stop taking my metformin
an a1c of 6.5 is still in the diabetic range
its a risk i would not take  the price is just to high work with your doc tell them what you wish to do and work out a plan  you pay them to help you  best wishes harlen hi my numbers have been out of control for a while now a1c 13 at last testing blood glucose in the 300 -500 just can't seem to get it under control
plus it managed to lower my bg levels so much i could discontinue them and achieve an a1c of 5.5%
my a1c this last time, 6/15/2015, was 8.7 which is the same as my last one
my last a1c was 7.2 the lowest i have been able to get it to is 6.9
anyways, the last a1c was 6.5 and i am trying to make my busy schedule as a grad student work out
but my a1c is 6.1 so that is good
no my bg's are good my a1c is 6.2 that's why i've been so confused on how i've been feeling lately thanks for all the info oh sorry i just notice this other post
best wishes harlen i did not have a complete conversation with her on the phone other than my repeated labs and a1c (7.5) led her to the diagnosis
in the meantime, let me just say that the ada is happy with any of us who keep our a1c readings below 7 as a goal and you are close to that already
when i went to my doctor my a1c was a 8.7 which is kind of bad because my family and i have been working our way down to a 7
also i want to encourage you&hellip; i used to have an a1c of 13 and now i'm 7.4
my last a1c was 6.4 and i'm expecting it to be a bit lower this next time&hellip; this is what happened to me
not sure if this helps michelle cuz i am also still learning but was proud of myself because i read so much and went into this determined to fight for myself my first 3 months brought my a1c down from 8.7 to 6.6, so i guess i did something right
my a1c level was 15.7
tml english my a1c test, came out to 7.6
my a1c was 6.7&hellip;down from 18.9 six months earlier
when first admitted into the hospital my a1c was 17.4(yikes
but after my first checkup appointment my a1c has come down to a 5.9
my a1c's were never over 5 while i was on the pump&hellip;  my neuropathy pain in my feet and legs went almost completely away and i tended to do better with my diabetes care while i was on the pump
i found out some really great news yesterday in that i have been taken off the diabetes medications since i had an a1c level of 5.6 for the second time in a row
well my doc took my a1c 3 months ago
now since that date i have lowed my a1c level to 7.4
my a1c is 7.9 and she thinks it will lower it
tml english when i was diagnosed with type 1 in december 2008, my a1c was 13.9%
i did the mail away a1c from reli-on and it was 5.7%
however, the argument is if you get complication after 20 years (or other long period of time) they are chalked up to having diabetes for a long time but what if it's because an a1c of 6.5-7 is really too high because non-diabetics with much lower a1cs don't get the same complications
when i get my testing to get the pump my a1c was 4.9
wants me around 5.5 to 6.5a1c but my last one was 5.1 a1c,talk to your doc
don't you know that for the 2 weeks before easter and for the 2 weeks after easter (so you can get the stuff on sale) that white chocolate has no carbs/sugars and it helps to lower your a1c by 2 points if you eat at least 1/2 pound a day
i didn't have any kind of side effects and in that 6 months i was able to bring my a1c from 7.6 to 5.6 and that was during the holiday season
my a1c's have usually ranged from 7-8.5, but ever since i got the dexcom, they have been significantly down
diagnosed in may with an a1c of 9.7
on top of that i had a discussion with my podiatrist over a year ago in which he pointed me to a study (i wish i had the source material to link on the internet) where they compared a1c results over a period of 50 years and determined there was no difference in "complications" with people who had a1c in the 6s and those who had an a1c in the 7s&mdash; but  they did find that there was a higher mortality rate for people in the 6 a1c group
the nurse went over everything with me - she said my a1c was within normal range (hell, i didn't even know what an a1c was to ask more about it)
i have gained 20 pounds in the last 6 months and my a1c was 13 on my labs last week
my a1c went from 14 to 5.4
my a1c was 15+ 8 weeks ago, and my vision was blurry, along with other symptoms, that was enough to scare the crap out of me
trying to figure out what amount and type of insulin and readings of a1c at 13, they finally figured out i am a type 1
i am not only type 2 dibetic, i am in end stage renal failure&hellip;ask you doctor if a renal diet might help lower your a1c, on renal diet my a1c dropped from 12.8 to 7.4 in a 90 days period&hellip;my a1c is now a constant 7.0 remember ask you doctor&hellip; i've had type 1 for 35+ years now and have been doing multiple (4) shots/day
tml english hey dc friends it's been awhile i know just got my new a1cs from my endo on the 11  this day was also my one year aniverseary  i can honestly say it's been one hell of a journey
insulin was the wake up call i needed and now i am down 60 lbs and my a1c has been in the low 5s for the last year
my averages (150) and a1c are good (6.1) i just went over all of those things with the doc 2 weeks ago
before diagnosis a1c was about 11.7
on the other hand, my a1c has always remained around 6.0 to 6.2
my a1c is 5.4 and i "control" bg with diet and exercise
wish you the best an a1c of 7.4 is higher than ideal but it's hard to really go off that because one a1c doesn't tell you how long you have had diabetes
i had a bg of 612 that day and an a1c of 12.45
does your average bg reading during the day support an a1c if 5,5
hellip;that is the question i would be asking myself if i were in your boat&hellip;if you have great control and fully expected an a1c in the mid 5's because of it i wouldn't be too concerned about lows&hellip;if however it was a complete shocker i would be concerned&hellip;have you ever considered middle of the night testing
in any case i agree with gabby a second opinion is called for&hellip;i have had people tell me i am risking lows because my a1c hovers around 5&hellip;i am like&hellip;nooooooooo&hellip;first off i take no meds&hellip;secondly my daily test support that a1c&hellip;also&hellip;with an a1c of 5.5 i have to ask why you are still taking insulin&hellip;is your a1c being artificially kept down by insulin and oral meds
i do know one can have lows affect one's bg levels as my late wife had regular bg levels in the above 200 mg/dl levels yet had an a1c at one point of 6.0%
mine stopped once my a1c got down to 6 howdy john i have "enjoyed" the burning neuropathy of my knees down to my toes for many years now
struggling to get my a1c's back into the 6's&hellip;right now at 6.9 which i feel is still too high
i mean my  doctor has increased my metformin to 1,000 mg per day,  when i ride my bike it makes my back hurt for two or three weeks so i try walking on the treadmill which aggrevates my right  ankle,  over three months my a1c is gone to a 7.8 lately i  h e tried the wii which really is not to good, now i'm back to  trying to walk and my bone in my buttocks is very painful
in the past i've had a1c's as low as 5.9 but at last check i was 9.3 i dread getting my new results next week
you probably know that your a1c target is between 6 &amp; 7
i was just diagnosed as t2 last year, with an a1c of 12.7 - now it's  6.1, and the doc is very pleased, but that's up from the time before, so i have to be extra careful not to let it start creeping further up
i am on insulin and my a1c was about 9
no meter or instructions to get one and how to test &hellip; no referral to a specialist to get dietary counseling/info &hellip; sadly typical for diabetics testing on the (low side) while an a1c of 6.5 is considered just a smidge over the pre=diabetic level (5.7 to 6.4) it is my belief it should be addressed with the same concern and care of an a1cof 13.0
it takes time (generally a1c is done every 90 days) and faithful adherence to medications and dietary limitations, and exercising
tml english im going to the docter for a check up wenesday  at 9 am i saw my endocrinologist two weeks ago and while my a1c was high, i explained it by telling her about my two shots of cortisone and my 10 day supply of prednisone
i lost 62 lbs and my a1c went from 11
my priority right now is to keep my blood sugars as close to non diabetic as possible (huge diet change, exercise, medication) and that of course will lower my a1c and i am loosing weight because i am not eating all the calories i was eating before&hellip; i have polycystic ovarian syndrome (which makes me very insulin resistance - of course type 2 is also characterized by insulin resistance
hugs to all you can purchase the a1c test over the counter at walmart i have found it helps a1c test also otc at walgreens
tml english my a1c had dropped from 8.6 in january to 6.4 in june
also, great job on getting your a1c down to 6.4 that is awesome
my mom's a1c results came back and her reading is 7.6%
by limiting my daily carbohydrate intake to 120 grams per day, i have been able to keep my hba1c's in the 6's (good diabetic control) and my retinopathy has not progressed nor needed any treatment
i have had diabetes for over 18 years, i feel good, have no complications, enjoy life, and maintain an a1c around 6.0
i hate the idea of something hanging on my body like that&hellip;my a1c has never been over 6.5 and i am extremely regimentied and organized
my a1c is a constant .65ish
my a1c have been ranging from 6.0 to 7.5 the pump does give you more flexibility
i've heard of the t-slim , checked it out on line seems pretty fancy snazzy &hellip; should work great &hellip; i was using pens for almost a year and my #'s were just terrible &hellip; i got a pump by medtronic this past november &hellip; my #'s are lower , more stable &hellip; i went from an a1c of 13.7 to 7.5 and we believe on my test it will be lower &hellip; i love my pump
everyone is different, but i found that i could control my blood sugars much better with injections, and because i wanted to keep my a1c at around 5.5 in order to have more children, i didn't feel like the pump was worth it at the time
tml english i just got my a1c results back and its a 13.3
if this keeps up, my a1c will be around 8 from 11+ at my next appointment
my last a1c was 5.6
my last a1c was 5.7, so i will be eating this way for the remainder of my time here
i have been on it for about 7 mos and in may my a1c was 5.5, and as a side benefit i have lost 40+ lbs (maybe more by now)
the dr says we caught it early&hellip;my a1c was 6.8
god bless i can relate this disease can be very frustrating my bg goes anywhere from 27 to 300-400 at times gabbys advice is right on the mark i dont know about in your area but here in northwest ar we have a free health clinic if you qualify you can get your supplies for free or very low cost including an at home a1c test every 4 mos
my a1c is always below 6
i was diagnosed may 2007 with an a1c of 10.0
by october 2007, my a1c was 6.6 and by february 5.8
back in nov my a1c was 4.9, which i guess is really low, but still acceptible
my a1c was 10.4 and went to 5.9 in three months
my last hba1c was 6.9 and i'm hoping my next one will be lower
say you have an a1c of 6.5, your fasting readings are 115-120 and your post meal numbers are 140-160 always and have been for 15 years
however, what would have happened if for the previous 15 years your a1c was 5.5 or lower, your fasting between 80-90 and post meal between 90-110
tml english hi i'm rachel , im sixteen , i've had diabetes for about three years now , my recent a1c was a terrible 9.6%, quite honestly its embarrassing , and i do try really hard to normalize my sugars everyday
thank you x hi rachel, i know when i was 16 my hba1c was constantly over 10%, actually at one point i was making myself seriously ill and my hba1c was 13%
my a1c on april 12 was 12.7% and 2 weeks later it had dropped to 11.7% with severe dedication it will come down
my a1c last week was over 11%, and like you say it's quite frustrating
tml english i was diagnosed end of april a1c was 11.7, six weeks later down to 8.1,my most recent as of last week 5.5
i've had type 1 since 1965 and have had no complications and keep my a1c in the 6's
when first diagnosed my goal was to get under 7, then to get under 6 (which i have been for the past 6 months) so while prioritizing my goals (i have other health concerns)  i started wondering how much benefit there would be in reducing my a1c to the low 5's (cost benefit analysis, if you will)
i did come across dr bernstein's work and what he says makes sense to me and i am setting a sub 5.0 a1c as my long term goal and 5.6 for 3 months from now
his range for ha1c is 4.2 to 4.5
my a1c has remained in and around 6.0 for the entire 20 years that i've had diabetes
although an a1c of 7.0 or less, seems to be a common criteria, many endocrinologists recommend staying below 6.5, as of most recently
the goal is to keep the average bg low enough to keep you a1c below 7.0
the landmark dcct study proved that people with a1c's below 7.0 significantly reduce or prevent any complications
my a1c has been around 6 for many, many year now
my a1c was 7.0, so i am working to get it back to, at least 6.0
20815-a1c-reading-8
he increased the lantus because my a1c went over 8
when i 1st found out i was type ii, my a1c was 7.3
i've lowered my a1c to 5.5, and my weight about 40 lbs
:) oh, and btw, my last a1c about a week or so ago was 6.2
my may 2011 a1c was 5.5 and my bg numbers were at or very close to normal
well&hellip;i just called the dr office to find out what my first a1c was&hellip;back in april 2011 (around my initial diagnosis) my magic number was 11.4 and my new magic number from earlier this week is 9.7
my tests are very rarely above 200 but the a1c is always between 9.5 and 10.5
but during the same time frame she had an a1c of 6
since her a1c was 6, she must have had some mighty low lows
so having a lower a1c may not be as healthy for us as having a little higher a1c and not be on the bg roller coaster
gabby,   i really dont kno wat is my a1c is really i haven't seen my diabetic doctor in 6yrs pooh2135, you really should make an appointment to see your dr
knowing how to count carbs is a lot of work ,a frend has a 12 year old and she will not let her mom or dad tuch her pump she dose her owne carb counting and her last a1c was 5.9 ,bettter then me grrrrrrrr lol  i was that gave her the book the calorei king ,she dose a great job of it
the third test, which is one that is frequently used to confirm a diabetes diagnosis, is known as the glycosylated hemoglobin test, hba1c test, or just a1c
i prefer to eat "unprocessed" foods whenever possible, and have maintained my 5.5 a1c for many months with this approach (as well as loosing over 40 pounds)
i was diagnosed 4 months ago with type 2 and had an a1c of 10.5
i got my labs back, and this time my a1c is 6.2 and my doc
my starting a1c was 10.8
my last a1c is 5.0
tml english i went to the doctor yesterday my a1c was 9.2 my cholesterol is 592 and my micro albumin is 87
well to be honest with you techinally it didnt read 750 the exact thing it read is what you said high but with a good guess an from what all my ac1 30s r im sure at the very least its 750 well, according to that a1c you are running an average of around 800, so some times you are higher, and some times you are lower
debbyjf mentioned bringing her a1c from 13 to 5.9, that was the only a1c #s that i could see in this discussion
but with a good guess and from what all my a1c 30s are, i'm sure at the very least it's 750
my a1c got up to 13 but is now a happy 5.9
last week i met a fellow who's a1c was in the mid 8 range just diagnosed and his doctor did only three things before sending him on his way
i figured it was reasonably accurate because i can usually guess my a1c within .2% here is a link that you might find valuable
i have maintained  my blood glucose (bg) levels at or close to the "normal" range without relying on diabetes meds (mine had been insulin), my last a1c was 5.5, and i lost 65 lbs during the year
my a1c came back at 8.5, which was lower than i anticipated
cuz i was never on levemir so i didn't know ) anyway, my a1c was at 15% my body was full of acid
with some dancing and a lot of walking, and a good diet; i lost most of the weight and now my a1c is at 7.2%
when i had seen my endocrinologist several ago my a1c level was 9.6
my a1c was 5.3
my a1c has been between6-7
my new doctor waited 3 months for an a1c (9.8) then put me on insulin
my a1c is 6.2
a1c of 6.2 is excellent for a diabetic
first i am a type 2 and i do not know what the rules are for type 1, but a 6.2 a1c for a type 2 is not bad
if my a1c was at 6.2 i know my doctor would take me off of metformin
now the ada has set a new standard for a1c of 7
i suspect that the reason they set the a1c at 7 is because it can be more easily achieved with less of their killer drugs
with lifestyle, and very low carbohydrate intake, an a1c of 7 can be safe, it has worked for me for over 20 years
god's best to you james baker howdy rosalie yes an a1c of 7% can be safe for the intermediate time, however what about for the long haul
what i suspect (cannot prove) is that nerve damage doesn't  necessarily occur at 6 and in my experience  not at a1c 7 over the long term under certain conditions
finally my a1c was 6.5 with average of 140 mg/dll while the a1c targets were 3.6 to 6.8
i have never seen a 3.6 as a low end for a1c, but as long as you are below 7, you are doing great
well my thought is that since the range is for non-diabetics a 3.6 would be possible for a non-diabetic who has a lot of low blood sugar experiences while it may not be an ideal glucose a1c it would be at the low end just as the 6.8 would be at the high "target" range
i was briefly put on metformin when my a1c went above 6 but it is lower or was at last check long ago and i was taken off the metformin
tml english i am newly diagnosed type 2 nov a1c 7.5 now 6.2 and good bs control 95 to 128
your numbers must be good to have your a1c down to 6.2
if you are under 60 and diet and exercise controlled t2, with your weight in a good place, you can extend your "honeymoon" phase as long as possible by keeping your numbers where you have them, and your a1c will probably continue to drop into the 5s
if you are over 60, your doctor may want you to have your a1c no lower than 6
my a1c has been around 6.0 for the last 19 years
jigsaw actually talked me into upping my carb intake a bit as well from my extreme cuts, and even though i felt like i was cheating, my a1c went down .4 points
hga1c has never been over 6.8
because my a1c was 5.5, my doctor let me get off metformin
tml english hi everyone i just wanted to say how important it is to have your a1c test done at least 3 times a year
a 1% change in an a1c result reflects a change of about 30 mg/dl (1.67 mmol/l) in average blood glucose
for instance, an a1c of 6% corresponds to an average glucose of 135 mg/dl (7.5 mmol/l), while an a1c of 9% corresponds to an average glucose of 240 mg/dl (13.5 mmol/l)
the closer a diabetic can keep their a1c to 6%, the better their diabetes is in control
was diagnosed in june my a1c was 10.8 just got my new one at 5.8 my dr upd my metformin which im not happy about i have been holding my ac1 test to about 5.6 -5.8 this past year
if hes happy, i'm happy&hellip; after a week-long cruise where i didn't miss a dessert, including the midnight chocolate buffet, i was pleased to read that my a1c was 5.5, the lowest it's been in 10 years
my a1c test was up though at 6.4
a1c-5.5%  dr
thanks i just got my a1c test results back its 6.2 the last one was 6.7,also my hdl is 36 dr
i have my a1c test done 4 times a year
lanore today 7/30 my a1c is 7.4 compare to 9.1 a month ago
a1c was 7.9 a bit high but have been on steroids for 7 of the last 9 months
my last a1c was 5.7
i'm working really hard to get it down below 6.0 i go every 3 months and my last a1c was 6.3 down from 7.1 3 months earlier hello there, this is a great number
lanore if your doctor is supposed to be treating your diabetes, and has not talked to you about the a1c test, then it&#39;s time to find a new doctor
even with all those issues my a1c only went up by 0.1, i was expecting it to be closer to 7.0
i've been lucky, and know that even though a1c is low, and hdl is very high at 70, lipid panel is within normal limits, all is not well, as creatinine levels are going up
my doctor checks my a1c every 3 mos
in 3 months time my a1c dropped 2.4 points
i've had two years of a1c's in 5.4 to 5.7 and routinely stay in the 80's and 90's from diet and exercise
so, my a1c was 8.2%
my last a1c was 6.6 which indicates good control
there was a calculator somewhere online (i've lost the link now) that told me that based on my average daily bg readings that i'd have an a1c of 6.1 if i was tested that day
remember that a1c is an indication of what your control was over the past 2 or 3 months, although, with lower carb during the last month, it should be a bit lower than a month ago
i have been diabetic 25 years, and i have an a1c between 5.5-6.5 and my dr
and the only way that my hmo will do the surgery is if i bring my a1c down to a 5.0
but if sir harlan is correct &amp; it does take 3 mos 4 the a1c 2b lowered, i guess it can't be any quicker than that
great diet&hellip;i've been doing the same thing roughly for many years and my a1c has been in the 6's
i have also lowered my a1c from 6.7 to 5.5 in 3 months
cut the carbs and it will still take time to get it down  an a1c is a 90 day test or what it has ben over the last three months  best wishes harlen thanks, sir harlan
hello and welcome to dc family very cute baby i thought i would join group  nice to meet u thank you that is my granddaughter she just turned two jan 2 2011 alan i like red do you  have type 2 , what do people normally speak about here yes i am t2 most talk about anything they want mostly the problems with there meds or diabetes or doctor or weight  alan i have togo to doctor tommorow just for a checkup or a1c alan same 3 month checkup check all levels ok mine is in march alan good luck on app
steve i never know for sure when my doctor is going to do an a1c so i never get ready for a test i have 3 doctors who are always checking blood &amp; they all do an a1c but i thank god i've went from 8.9 to 6.1 the last a1c like 5 months ago but the ra doctor did one also i'm waiting to see what it was now
y a1c has remained between 6.0, and 6.2, the thought to cram for the exam, has crossed my mind, the large variety of non processed foods that i consume, has helped me to  maintain control to the point of becoming an almost subconscious act
i mean, i've lost 165 lbs, and gone from an a1c of over 15 down to 5.1, and gone off all meds
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
my a1c has remained below 6 for 2 years now
during this nine month time i had brought m a1c's down to 5.3 but the 12 years of not caring for myself lead me to have neuropathy and retinopathy
my hba1c's are in the 6's and i have minimal complications (some bit of neuropathy in my feet but nothing that bothers me) and evidence of diabetic retinopathy but nothing that has progressed in over 10 years
in 3 months, i went from 241 pounds to 194, my a1c from 7.8 to 6.1  i got off the couch and out of the drive through
my a1c is 5.5 and i am usually between 80-100 (i shoot for 85-95)
ive never had an a1c that low but once it was 6.1 and my doctor said i must have cheated lol&hellip;good for you tho
my last a1c was 6.7 but i'm sure the next one will be lower as my bg averages are now around 130
thanks for the input my a1c is 8.9 and my fasting was 233 but my bg has been as hi as 392 my biggest problem is i love my mountain dew i am trying to drink more water
tml english my a1c is down one point to a 6.2 i started out at a 7.6 6 months ago&hellip;  and ive lost another 5lb the weight is coming off very slow but at lest im loosing
type ii&hellip;my a1c started at 9&hellip;my dr about had a stroke&hellip;and i knew i had symptoms&hellip;but at the time, i had just lost my dad&hellip;in fact i found out the day after his memorial service&hellip;anyway&hellip;she too a1c again last month
i brought my a1c down somehow from 7.2 to 6.8; 2 weeks ago i had another one that read 6.8&hellip; ok, no change, but still not 7.2   i stopped seeing the nutritionist in august
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
my first a1c was 14
god bless, mary my first a1c was a 15
my a1c is good thou it went from 7.8 to 5.3 and  6.2 i have been trying to lose weight by using the treadmill for 30 mins each day for the last 8 weeks and only lost 2.5 pounds
with an a1c of 5-6 you are doing pretty well, so you might have to define &quot;soar&quot;
an a1c test is very important and so is knowing what the test result numbers mean, listed below are links to information and a video clip that explains the a1c test result numbers:    http://www
om/a1c-and-you/about-a1c/a
i was only diagnosed 3 months ago with t2 and at my first checkup bg down from 356 to 125 and a1c down from 13.1 to 7
oh&hellip;  a1c tends to run 6.8 to 7.2
even you a1c can be off by 10%
the week i went into labor, my a1c was 5% and my charlotte was perfect at 7lbs 5oz and 20 inches long
i started in feb 2011, my may a1c was 5.5, and i lost 50 lbs (even though i gave no thought to weight loss)
my a1cs have been good with the one touch so far so are the other 2 no good
my potassium levels were critically low at 2.3 and my a1c came back at 14
then i went to the doctor and my a1c went from 6.0 to like 7.4
tml english hi  i was diagnosed pre-diabetic with a1c of 5.8 because my sugars increased when i used my inhaled steriods for my asthma because i was having trouble losing weight and all otc diet aids and most presciption aids was counterindicated for me my primary put me on a trial of byetta lost 40 lbs  went off for 6 months then went back on - after the 1 month got what i thought was the flu - after no improvement went  in and saw the pa - had lab   my blood sugars went out of control  was put on lantus and antibiotics but it was not until i went seen endochronlogist 8 months later because i could not control my sugars and he was lookiing over my lab work and discussing my history that it was determined that i had medication induced pancreatitis and had burned out all my insulin producing cells
i have lost my endo - he moved out of state so i can not address this with him    note: since sept i have decreased my a1c from 8.9 ( down from 10.4 w/ lantus alone) to 6.2
my team of diabetis specialists believe that an a1c of 6.5, but no lower than 6.0 for a type ii will drastically cut the chances of related complications, and maybe even eliminate them
bernstein beleives the lowest a1c approaching 4.2 to 4.5 is good
with regular mediaction my hba1c remained in the range of 6.2 - 7.1
what could be the reason for such a low hba1c when fasting glucose is in the range of 120 - 130
since a1c is based on a 3 to 4 month average of ones bg, it would appear that you may be experiencing lows, and maybe not aware of it
my a1c last month was 5.4
a1c in the 6's is fine
interesting topic jigsaw&hellip;at age 67 i find myself with a a1c of 6.1 i have been a t2 for 12 years and currently on insulin and metformin
i fully expect my a1c to be below 6 when i go have it checked in 10 days
do i keep on doing what i am doing and see how low i can get my a1c or do i cut back on my insulin and keep my a1c around where it is now having had the same question, i'll tell you what i would do, and what i have actually done
i have maintained an a1c of 6.0 to 6.2 for almost 19 years, with the blessing of quite a few doctors
my last a1c was 5.4 and my endo said she doesn't want me going any lower
all i can say is that being on the pump has been nothing short of a miracle for me (less lows and my hba1c two weeks ago was 5.8)
as you can tell, i am new here and new to the diagnosis (about 3 weeks ago after a fgt, a1c followed by a ogtt i was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes)
my glucose levels were as follows:   fasting 155 1/2 hr 277 1 hr 362 2 hr 369 3 hr 243   and my a1c was 8.8
i've only been diagnosed for about 7 months now, but i went from an a1c of nearly 8 to now, 5.8 for over a month, & my average sugar is between 100 & 115
i was able to cut my basal rate by 10 units, drop my a1c to 6.2(my lowest), lose 35 pounds, and cut my bolus insulin
people  tend to forget the goal:  an a1c in the 6's
if your a1c is 7 or more, you have to pull the emergency switch a go no-carb which will get you down (unless your meds are totally wrong)
since my a1c was in the 6's, i felt comfortable continuing my low-carb approach
a1c 8.8% to 6% in 3 months
i am a male 43, i am been diagnosed in 1st week of jan 2013, surfaced in my physicals,since it was 204 , doc ordered for a1c it came up at 8.6%
my new results last week revealed my levels are at 124 fasting with a1c  6% , i lost 15lbs
my a1c is 6.5 and so we are going to up my metformin to 1000 mgs
my a1c is 9.6 last week
they have lowered their a1c recommendations to between 6 and 6.5
keeping my bg's close to normal levels, and have lost weight, and my most recent a1c (may) is 5.5
oh btw&hellip; my a1c at one point was 12.6&hellip; i am now down and have kept it down for almost 2 years to 5.2 - 5.4   that would have never happened without testing&hellip; you just cannot test 1 time a day if you are a diabetic unless you really understand your body and you truly know what to eat and how your body process' everything
there was a lady in the hospital the day before younger than myself who's a1c was 1500 she died the same day she was brought to the hospital
the thing that makes or breaks our a1c&#39;s are our tools and our determination
even with testing 1-2 times a day, i can keep my a1c at 6.7, but i have been as low as 6.4 with more testing
my a1c was 5.7 last month when my doctor checked
i was dx in oct 2010 with an a1c of 7.1
as of nov 2011, my a1c was down to 5.7 and i expect it to be even lower given my recent averages of daily bs
my fasting blood sugar today was 283, a1c is 10.8, and just took my 2 hr after dinner bg and it is 377
my a1c is 6.1, not my bmi
i got complacent over that time and my a1c got all the way up to like 13 and a temporary doctor put me on insulin
a1c is 6.5 up from 6.3 6 months ago
my lowest a1c was at 5.4 and would have stayed there if i didn't have a life changing event which gave me so much stress that i started eating wrong again
stress was running my life and through that my a1cs popped up to the 7s and i was extremely unhappy for that
my a1c is now in the 5.8-5.9 range consistently because i watch every bite i eat and exercise daily
have to take another a1c on december 1 so that when i see the endocrinologist, i will be ok (at least i have a great excuse right now &mdash; it certainly is not because i am eating too much, i barely eat as much as 1000 calories per day
i test about 6-8 times a day and my a1c is 5.8
tml english i had 8.1 a1c and high bs up to 290
my a1c had been in the 6 range for some time (years), and it hopped up to 9.4 in december, and this after more than doubling my lantus and really scaling up the humalog
a few yrs ago i was having some hypo feelings and a1c was done at that time 5.5
i was told i didn't need to test again after a second a1c came back 5.5
recently i had another a1c done and it came back as 6.1
for me, i need to limit my carbs to no more than 120 total carb grams per day to maintain my a1c in the 6's and keep my weight at 120 lbs
i know it will never be spot on with an actual a1c test but atm i'm off my about .6   my last rest was 6.6
my calculated a1c was only 6.0   long story longer
and when i get my a1c's they range between 5.9 and 6.3 but i think its because i'm a hypoglycemic t2 diabetic and my bs will go real low and then it will spike way high close to 200 and then will come back down to normal for a bit so i feel like i'm on a rollercoaster ride all the time
my last a1c was 5.8 my goal is 5.6 or less (and to get off the met) and eventually get to an a1c og 5.0 or less
i am a t2 and when diagnosed almost 3 yrs ago my a1c was 7.5, it is now 5.7 and has been for over a year now
when he told me that my fasting blood sugar was 106 and my a1c was 5.8
he redid blood work and in the 4 almost 5 weeks that i was changing my diet i did get some number changes the fasting blood sugar only went down 3 points to 103 but the a1c went down to 5.4 so it was doing some good
tml english so, my first a1c was 6.5
my second a1c was 5.7
then i got a call from the nurse last night around 7pm telling me my a1c had dropped to 5.4 and i only have to check my numbers in the mornings when i get up and as long as they are below 120 i do not have to worry with the rest of the day as long as my diet stays the same yay
that was all i needed to lose, i am at ideal weight now, i got off the pills after losing that, a year ago, and my last a1c was 5.4
my starting a1c when i was diagnosed was 13.8 so i am hoping the diet and exercise can help me bring mine down also
i just found out on friday that my a1c is down to 6.1 from 7.5
my a1c went up from 5.7 to 6.0 and i'm not sure why except that it has been too hot to walk durig my lunch hour
or just a diet and excercise i need a better diet my a1c was at 7.1
my doctor tells me any a1c below 6.0 is a non diabetic level
i have a type 2 friend who has had several a1c's in the high 4's
i also learned that until recently an a1c could not diagnose a diabetic and it still takes 2 of them being 6.5 or higher to be diabetic
i am type1 and would love to get my a1c's lower than 6
i want to say last monday they drew blood but i am not sure of all the results i assume they were good cause they never called with the results i had to call them to get my a1c, of 6.8, iron of 126, and that was all i got i will have to wait till i go back in to get the rest of them
last a1c on jan06 was  6.6 (not too bad, i think)
my a1c has been under 6 for som time now and my doctor wants me to stop metformin &hellip; which i will if (when) my a1c come this may is 5.6 or lower
if your a1c is less than 6, you are probably experiencing acute lows (my biggest enemy) because you are having to correct with humalog/novalog which is like carefully handling dynamite to me&hellip;  i don't believe you can stay in that range without the lows with many carbs and have sustainable weight loss
i'm not against a vegan diet, but it's benefit pales in comparison to the benefit of maintaining an a1c in the 6's
i've finally gotten my a1c's back in the 6's but have to deal with some scary lows
my experience with very low carb, high protein for the past 6 months  keeping my bgs close to the normal range without insulin or other meds and losing about 40 lbs, and my may 2011 a1c at 5.5 would beg to differ with hope warshaw
now i am off of insulin, had success with an experemental eating plan, and kept my blood glucose close to "normal" and my last a1c was 5.5
my a1c was 12.6
and i just ame back from my dr 2 days ago had an a1c of 5.9 correct its all about carbs not the sugar however sugar raises you bg faster just like fruit juice hey, you just pick yourself back up and it'll work out
i have managed to normalize my bg levels, achieve an a1c of 5.5 and lose about 65 lbs since i started my experiment in feb 2011
tml english they took me off my bipolar medicine,cuase it kept my a1c high,my bs was never as high as alote of you have 200 to 500 was the highest it was,im very moody now the only thing they can give me is depacote to suppress my moods,but my a1c's is in the 6's now an my bs is in the 95 to 120 range, has anyone got the same problem,feeling like i've got roded in life
tml english hemoglobin a1c:  component h g b a 1 c %   my result:  5.8 standard range 4.3 - 5.8 units %   how significant is this reading compared to pre-diabetic
lol   my last 3 a1c's were 5.3, 5.2, and 2 months ago, 5.1
my a1c isnt' amazing my father's is like 6.0 on insulin and he's been a diabetic type 2 for nearly 2 decades
tml english thrilled with myself&hellip;latest a1c is 4.9&hellip;without meds&hellip;nice&hellip;liver function
using that i had eliminated the use of  insulin (i know, not an option for you) lowered my a1c to  5.5 and maintained my bg numbers in the normal ranges, and i lost 65 lbs of fat
tml english here we are back on a1c again - has anyone any idea how how the a1c chart goes
keeping your a1c at 7 or below helps
4119-new-a1c-5-7
tml english yesterday the 24th was my birthday and i got my a1c back which came in at 5.7%
thank you i am a type 1 and my a1c was 7.6 12 months ago
my last 2 a1c were 5.4 i have a check up coming in oct 14 hope my a1c is still below 7.0 congratulations
my last a1c was 14, dr
this is what helped me lower my a1c from 14.1 to 5.9 in less than 4 months
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
just go back and start with the basics you did when you had lower a1cs  if you do, next time you do the a1c, it may be back down
my a1c's can be over 10 sometimes and less than 5 other times
the dentist states my a1c must be under 10.0
my a1c is 6.5 because i stay disiplined
i'm currently trying to find ways to stay focus and disciplined to get my a1c down  under 10 within the next 3 months
a person without diabetes has an a1c of between 4.8 to 5.6, that too should be a goal
i got my a1c down from 14 to 5.5
my blood suger was alright, my a1c went up to 7 and it started getting more difficult to control it
my a1c then went up to 10
every six months now that my a1c is below 7
the study, which included almost 300 type 2 diabetics, showed that those taking exenatide once weekly over the course of one year or for just 30 weeks lowered their a1c by average of 2.0 and their fasting plasma glucose (fpg) by 47 mg/dl
after 52 weeks, 74 percent of all patients achieved an a1c of 7 percent or less &mdash; the target the ada recommends for good glucose control
turned out his a1c was down to 5.5 and the dosage of metformin was no longer needed
my last a1c was 7.0 (lost some ground from the prior 6.7) and i've begun to exercise more and really, really be careful about counting those carbs
i am far more concerned about my a1c than i am about my cholesterol and i can do a1c tests at home if i want to
take care it sounds like you may have low blood sugar to let everyone know im still unsure whats going on my dr did a lay to sit to stand blood pressure test an a1c test wich came back 4.5 he said thats low he took me off my januvia and told me to go really strct on my diat,hes not sure whats going on im seing him again in the morning
a1c 7.2, average bs 160
do you think if i can have my bs's in the 100-110 range in mornings and a a1c of 6 or less, my doc will hold off on meds
my a1c is 5.7, cholesterol 170, ldl109, hdl61
your a1c of 11.2 means that you&#39;ve been running very high blood sugars for months
when my a1c test comes back as 7.1 and the doctor tell me that's really good, i say bs, i just made myself have a no
when my a1c test comes back as 7.1 and the doctor tell me that's really good, i say bs, i just made myself have a no
with the t 1 she stated under comments that it raised her a1c from 6.2 to 8.1%   the gent with t 2 commented that he now has a "terrible" cough
when i test levels its about 104 to 191(higest i seen) your a1c is very good, a lot better than mine at my last check (7.7), but your bg's look pretty much the same as mine
non diabetic a1c should be 4.8-5.6
glycemic control       a1c  1.1 mmol/l)   *postprandial glucose may be targeted if a1c goals are not met despite reaching preprandial glucose goals
in the last year and a half i have taken my a1c from like a 10 down to a 5.4
lab results came back today: a1c was 5.6, and glucose was 99
my a1c is 5.8, my weight has decreased by 55 lbs in the last year with little effort and i feel better and have more energy and i sleep better at night
at that time my a1c was 6.8
my new a1c is 6.0
my a1c went from 14.1 to 5.6 in about 7 months
anything under 180 will give you an a1c in the 6's which is all you need
and my a1c dropped 1 pt in 3 months-not a great accomplishment to me since i'm poking myself atleast 7 times a day between the byetta, humalog and levemir
dropping your a1c a full point in 3 months seems like a great step in the right direction to me
a1c range from 5 (which means you are "normal"  mine have been up due to illness etc  the last one was 7  which for me isn't good
my last a1c was 6.9 and i was very happy about that
my newest a1c was 5.5 but i would have never guessed it was going to be that good
se of diabetes meds, achieve an a1c of 5.5%, lost 65 lbs over 5 mo time, and kept it off for 3 + yrs
my last a1c was 7.0 and i'm hoping to get it lower
yes, my a1c was originaly 12.3, now it is down to 6.5, so that is how they know i'm getting control
my a1c just came in the mail today and it went from 6.5 to 6.1, so i'm still making progress
i was diagnosed type 2 in march 2015, a1c 10.7
yep all tests were fine and in the uk 6.8 was good for those of us in the us, it sounds like your hpa1 is what we call hba1c which measures how well glucose control has been in the past 2 to 3 months
tml english had great news today, my hba1c is at 6.2
my a1c is 9.0%, not good
tml english ehhh my hba1c is 10 :( i'm taking humalin 30/70 and novo rapid anddddd i am even basically strving myself now on herbalife any help here
i pray this has made sense to you and that you can get your a1c in a better place in another 90 days
best score i've gotten on a test in years&hellip;especially my a1c test&hellip;lol&hellip; i got 16 out of 17 &amp; am now kicking myself&hellip;lol i guess i never took my mom seriously when she said never second guess yourself
my sugars are pretty good, my last a1c was 6.1
i've found that by limiting my carbs to 120 grams per day, i am able to maintain my weight at 120 lbs and my a1c in the 6's&hellip;last one was 6.6
my a1c is lower than expected, my kidneys, liver and other vitals all functioning within normal parameters, fasting glucose well below 140, 20 minutes of walking brought my sugar down from 214 to 90 in less time insulin would have
a1c of 5.8 (10.0 at dx) i would ask what kind of exercise do you get
oddly all my complications have occured while maintaining an a1c at or below 6.0 (past 7 years) interesting
my a1c is 5.4 & has been that for over 6 months
his a1c is now 6.0 and he does splurge from time to time
my a1c's are consistently between 6.7 and 7.1 which corresponds to a bs level in the mid 100's
unfortunately, because of a stent in my heart, the doc would like to see me with an a1c of less than 6.9
tml english i have diagnosed with type 2 diabeties for about 1 year, my last 3 a1c results have been 4.7, 4.8 &amp; 4.3 repectivley
im fairly new and have only had one a1c since my diagnosis it was over 17 when diagnosed a month ago it was below 6  do you have a lot of lows
brought my a1c down to 5.6
i used to drink cinnamon tea at least once daily and my hba1c went down to 4.8%
when my doc saw my bg test diary and a1c (latest is 5.9), he said, "there is no need for you to test everyday&hellip;you're just torturing yourself"  he told me to test once a week
tml english my most recent hba1c went down from 138 to 46
my a1c reading was 6.0% howdy larry  welcome to dc
i was in complete denial&hellip;   then the realization came home one day when my bg was 478 and my a1c was 13.5
tml english hey guys thanks to all for support when a1c was 9.2 got physical today down to 8.2 i am really working more aware of my diabetes excercising more i know everday is a great blessing but next may 4 i will be 65 and i hope to still be blessed in ady vance thanks to all
hello, my last a1c was 7.2 which is just .1 lower than yours
and alot of people on this site share their a1c scores&hellip;i'm still working on what all the numbers mean, (never been really explained to me, i know its an average of my levels, but its different than what i get on my meter) anyways, my last a1c was a 7.3 and i was told i need to get that lowered
an a1c is an averae of what your blood sugars have been for the past 3 months
i think that an a1c of 7.3 means that your blood sugar average has been around 150-160
you just need to tweak it a little bit an a1c of 7.3 would suggest a bg average of about 130 mg/dl
if you managed to keep an average of 104, your a1c would be about 5.8
finally, a recommendation comes that will send a patient with an impaired glucose or fasting glucose tolerance, or an a1c in the pre-d range to a qualified weight loss program to get rid of 7% body weight
hen i found out i was a type 1 diabetic and almost died with an a1c of 17.5 she found out i was sick, she called me i didnt know what to think i was happy, durring the call she made the comment ill never for get,aww, its to bad this has happened to you you were such a pretty girl ,its to bad you lost it all, i didnt know what to think out of pure rage and sadnees i hung up cried for days havent spoke to her sence, but on days like to day this really hurts,im not really sure why i will never be or mean any thing to her, but im very glad you have some one for you i hope you all have a very wounderful mothers day, some people take no responsibility for anything really
after retiring and teaching part time for a few years i was having good blood sugar control with a1c's below 6.0
this endo also got me to try an insulin pump in 2011 and i haven't had a seriously low bg since and my a1c's are back in the high 6's and 7.0 (the last one)
my last a1c was mid-january and was 7.0 pammysue, you are taking 2000 mg of metformin a day
but my a1c in oct 2011 was 6.5 and last month was 7.7
bg runs 88 to 114 and a1c 5.7 to 6.0
my a1c went from 10.6 to 6.4
nice to know i can have the rare "splurge" &hellip; it will be interesting to see what the a1c in november comes in at &hellip; anything under 6 and i will be happy
a1c was above 9 last time and i just felt like crying
the american diabetes association recommends an a1c of 7% or lower
when i started, had an a1c of 11^ and bg of 525
now, a1c of 5.6 and my bg runs 86 to 104
and i am maintaing a a1c of 5.6
my triglycerides were 1864, cholesterol was 434, a1c was 12.3
my last a1c 6.3
my numbers have been good and now my a1c is now every 6 months my labs are done every 3 months or less
tml english just got my a1c back down to 5.6   long way from 7.4   now my new battle is to quit smoking  i battled the first one now on to the next all the while keeping first in check i have not been on hear a lot but plan to change that you guys are awesome i may call on some of you for support advice and a shoulder to help me quit i became a non smoker 15 years ago after smoking 5 packs a day (yes, that is correct, 5 packs a day and even got up during the night just to smoke) for more years than that
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
well, i am now 30 pounds lighter than last year (5'11" and currently at 169) so i am hopeful that my a1c (average blood glucose over 3 months) is in a decent range
i find i can maintain my weight at 120 lbs and keep my hba1c test results in the 6's by eating no more than 120 grams of carbohydrate per day
a1c 5.9 and ldl cholesterol 67
my a1c is now 7.5 (as of last thursday)
have an a1c between 4.9-5.2, not on any diabetic meds or supplements, and if i can get my good cholesterol up just one point yet, i'll be textbook normal
weighed 112 pounds and a1c was at 6.9
blood test cholesterol went down but a1c went up to 7.3 on the diet
so i modified my diet and my a1c is now down to 6.4 - did a home test this month
i do not want to be on diabetes meds - is it bad to have an a1c at 6.4 and not be on meds
my a1c was only 6.9 when i was eating what i wanted
best med for diabetes is straight out insulin &hellip; least amount of side effects &hellip; generally an a1c in the 6's is considered good for a person with diabetes and reflects good control
my last a1c was 6.8 but i'm a type 1 on an insulin pump and will never be able to eliminate my diabetes meds
my a1c has been at 6.5 for quite sometime and i am on medication
my first a1c was 6.9 and immediately my doctor wanted to put me on meds
your a1c at 6.4 is awesome, idk if you want to lose more weight but to me, you've lost enough&hellip;sorry it scares me&hellip;i've been type 2 a while&hellip;and if you're losing weight but not on purpose talk to your doctor well i actually am losing weight on purpose, went from 2,500 calories plus a day to 800 calories
if your a1c is 6.4 already you do not need meds you really think i may be able to get away with not taking meds at this time
my a1c also was off the charts once i got to the doc 6 weeks ago
i got the results from the doctors office about my a1c yesterday and it took me this long to come to terms about what i was told i have to do till my next visit on august 31st
what i don't understand is my a1c was 5.5, so how can my blood sugars be that high
all i can say dee is you might have had some mighty powerful  lows you came through since the a1c is an average of your bg numbers for 90 days or so
my bride jem had bg levels which were at times 300 to 400, yet her a1c  was only 6.5
he said that to me sept 09 when my a1c came back 9, after my last surgery 2 years ago they were between 6.0 and 7.5
he gave me a month oct 09 my a1c 8, he said come back in 3 months a1c 7.6
he said come back in 6 months a1c 7.5
my numbers are pretty good 95-112 and my a1c was 7.4 now it's 6.1
it focused on maximum a1c reduction versus maximum weight loss&hellip;it is my doctor's opinion that focusing on lowering your a1c to under 6 should be a diabetics number one priority&hellip;while also trying to slowly lose weight&hellip;i argued that getting to ones ideal weight/bmi should be the priority while keeping your a1c under 7&hellip;then once your weight is gone&hellip;focus more on lowering your a1c&hellip;i based my opinion on the fact that extra weight in and of itself is detrimental to insulin resistance&hellip;we went back and forth for hours&hellip;opinions please
so, with my last a1c a 5.9, i'm refocusing and making losing weight a priority
at least your doctor didn&#39;t say it was okay to just douse yourself with drugs and an a1c of 7 was fine
to tell some one on insulin to shoot for a a1c of under 6 is down right dangerous
s opposed to focusing on a1c which is just one health marker that measures one symptom of diabetes&hellip;my doctor thinks the weight issue might be too overwhelming for a newly diagnosed diabetic to deal with&hellip;and because a1c can be brought into line much quicker than weight feels it is the way to go
i forgot to add my a1c 6.0 when first diagnosed, i dove in with both feet
yes i agree&mdash; which comes first &hellip;ckn or egg&hellip; seems to me the weight loss is paramount while that in itself lowers a1c &mdash; or at least in my case they go hand in hand &mdash; also my a1c is 6.2 now &mdash; i haven't lost more weight since the a1c was higher &mdash; soooo perhaps that changes at some point
isn't it true that keeping your a1c at 7 or below, you are out of the high risk category
true&hellip;i am exactly 1 pound from my goal weight and have maintained my a1c under 5&hellip;they did go hand and hand
my hba1c has gone from 7 to 5.1 in that time
lowest a1c so far has been 4.9, but holding at 5.2 now
i maintained an a1c of 6.0 with a combination of the atkins diet, and exercise for a few years
over the last 20 years, i have maintained an a1c of 6.0 with little variation
got my wife looking for the ones ive trid 1 is the beef fajitas and the beef strogan off a crook pot started making several doctors appointmenst and illl be looking to see the nutrinist so i know the amount deitary and cals i need to work on getting my a1cs to norm for a t2 wonderful
really luv, there is a way to get your a1c down into the 5s, but i won't tell you simply because it is so very dangerous to do
just reduce your carbohydrate intake and let you a1c come down naturally within the 90 days required
congratulations on your a1c of 5.4, keep up the great work
when i was first diagnosed, my a1c number was 11
i wanted that freedom, the ability to cover for a sweet if i wanted the odd treat; the ability to go from an a1c of nearly 8 on diagnosis, to 5.8 in under 6 months
renee stanton lowered her a1c from 11.6% to 7% over the course of the study
hello everyone,   my name is ms katurah,i live in maine with my 2nd hubby and 4 sons(3 now) i was just rx with type 2 and my a1c was 8.5
you have to keep your a1c under 7&hellip;whatever that takes
my a1c just hit 7
one gentleman had gotten his a1c down to 5.7 and his doctor told him he was no longer diabetic
my last a1c was 6.6 so there's still room to improve but a year ago it was 7.5
my last a1c was 10.6, today it is 8.1, better, but a long way to go still
you need to talk to your doctor and ask if byetta would be good for you i have lost 68 pounds and lowered my a1c from 12.4 to6.2 in 7 months on byetta  and metformin and diet maybe we can help you to get on track if we have a bit more info&hellip; do you test your blood sugar
my a1c this month was 5.4

i do like your a1c number great job it&#39;s really common for you eyes to be blurry when your bs are high
an a1c of 5.9 is very good
my last a1c was 7.0
i managed to keep my bg levels in the normal range, my may 2011 a1c reading was 5.5 (well within normal) and i lost approximately 50 lbs
it's been three years now with a1c of 5.4 or less without medication
my a1c went down a little from 5.4 to 5.1
my a1c was 13+ at that time
i worked hard and got it down to 6.8 but then in march, i fell and broke my hand and i guess that affected my desire to keep working because my next a1c was 10.8 so back to the drawing board
usually, once you get below an a1c of 7, the put you into a 6 month visit schedule

my a1c was about 11 and i weighed 250
i find that if i limit myself to 120 grams of total carbohydrate per day, i can maintain my weight at 120 lbs and have an acceptable a1c&hellip;last one was 6.7
i do not have insurance so i went to the sheperds hope (part of the lutheran church with volunteers), on june 30 they sent me for blood work, went back on july 7 to find out my a1c was 6.4
a1c fell 0.50 percent on the low-gi diet compared with only 0.18 percent on the high-fiber diet, dr
i don't think&hellip;   i thought that type 2 was reversible like if you got a normal range on your a1c level, like a 4
my a1c was 9.1 now it is 6.1
my a1c is 5.7
an a1c of 6 is a good thing
i don't really understand it either but that's what he said i will be on pills if my blood work is good my jem came back at a1c of 6 a couple of times when she was alive
and this all happened when my control has been quite good, my last a1c was 7.2, and it has been around that or lower for the past 2 years

my a1c was up my daily bg averages were around and above 230 now my a1c is on the way down, went from having to take insulin to not having to take insulin and average bg staying between 95 and 110 and lost 15 lbs
in my experience  over many years, it is better to have a1c a little higher than to have  a great a1c with diabetic drugs
on the bright side, i have been able to stay perfectly healthy, with an a1c of 7
i eat grains, at least 1/4 cup of uncooked rolled oats, every day &hellip; my a1c has been under 6 for years
i was diagnosed last year with an a1c of 14.1 and four months later it was 5.9

i did and was tolod that i was type 2, and my a1c level was 10.5
may i go back, towards the middle of the month and have some more blood work done and while i was there the dr checked a1c also, it was 6.8
my worst a1c so far has been 5.6
i've lost 60 lbs and my a1c is great so i'm not trying to use it as a means of diabetes control, but just thought if it wked then it could be another tool in managing diabetes along w/ what i'm already doing&hellip; that's all congratulations on the weight loss and a1c
my a1c from 6.2 my doctor uses the number 6.8 as thepoint where you become t2 diabetic
my weight goal is 150 pounds and my a1c goal is under 7 by the end of the year
u r and example for everyone   bingo my new year's resolution is to have a weight between 130-135 and an a1c of 7 also
my last a1c was 6 which sounds great, but i had so many very low's, the a1c was perfect
ok so i was wrong mu a1c is 5.6 not 6
a1c is down to 6.0 ys and i had stop 2 med cuz i didnt like the way they made me feel
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
gary great job tammy my lowest a1c (7.0) was recorded when i was on metformin
i think we have different measurements as yours were 7 and mine was 58 and he said they were good for a person with diabetes, i can only strive to get it below 40 :) good luck finding a good doctor,mine is awesome and despite ive moved a fair distance i have kept him as my doctor cos i like him that much a1c is an average blood reading over several weeks (approximately 3 month average)
the number is a percenatge of something and the doctors want a1c to be below 6
my a1c has been as high as 14 and the doctor had a fit
my bp is being well managed and a1c's have come back great for 2 yrs
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
my a1c was 6.9 last time, next a1c is in a few weeks and i'm hoping to be in the mid to lower 6's
prior, my a1c was 10.9
so when you have an a1c of 7%, you could spend half of your time with the blood glucose level of 100 and the other half the time 180 (frying your nerves)
in fact, it was during this time that i had my lowest ever a1c of 5.9
my last a1c was 6.8 but i'm expecting improvement next month when it's tested again
the last time i saw my endo she felt no reason to see me for 6 months, but my pcp wanted to go ahead and do an a1c anyway at the 3 month check time and it was only up 1point, so not bad at all after being off insulin for 3 months
my endo uses it on me, but when i went dec11th, my a1c was over 14
something and it didn't register over that&hellip; my endo uses it on me, but when i went dec11th, my a1c was over 14
("hb a1c" or "a1c" for short) a measure of average blood sugars over 3 month   a blood sugar" blood sugar of 6.8 or even 18 may very well put her into  dibetic coma for hypo glycemia
it means a switch from % to mmol/mol, for example an a1c of 7.0 is 53 in the new unit
also, my a1c went from 6.0% down to 5.3%
at the beginning of the year my a1c was 14
i am proud to say my a1c has gone done to 7.1 from 11 and i have lost over 31 pds since oct
awesome job&hellip;my a1c is 9.0 that's amazing keep up the good work
my a1c was 6.8 now it's 5.5
and if you have an a1c below 8 (that is not even a well managed number) they would not be allowed any strips under this consideration
tml english i have neurothapy nerve damage to my feet, why is the pain getting worse when my a1c is good 5.8, lost alittle weight and going to a fittness center 3 times a week
technically, if you lower your a1c to 6.3, you are no longer diabetic, you're pre diabetic
technically if you lower your a1c to 6.3 you are a diabetic with an a1c of 6.3
i did it for almost 8 years, and it didn't give me good control (a1c at the time averaged 9.4)
i have good a1cs, last one was 5.6 good luck eat the exact same food at the exact same time on two different days and get two different reading
his a1c is 5.3 and he has lost almost all of his overweight during the past 15 months
my a1c is 5.6 and i stay between 70 and 130 about 90% of the time but i do have occasional highs and lows
if your a1c, done every 3 months, is 6.0 or under, you have greatly reduced your risk of complications from diabetes
my a1c is 6.2 and i feel better than i have beenn in a long while&hellip;  the doctor told me my near death experience with diabetes stemmed from stress
that was a brutal experience take it gradual on the meds because "to me" it seems you are on a lot to get the a1c that you have and what a good a1c
tml english do anyone have trouble with your am bsl, my insulin at 36 nite, 6 am, trying to get am under 110, hang   around 114, after eating around 140, is that to bad, trying to get a1c under 7, they are 7.6 now, thanks what i suggest is talking to your doctor about your goals
i have been swimming for 6 weeks, it really worked last year, but this year, my a1c has gone up from 6.1 to 6.4, still not too bad, but it seems ok most of the day, but at bedtime it can jump to 200, so then take my glipizde, only 1/2 or such as it hits me so hard, but my hi for fasting has been 125 to 130 more or less,lately&mdash;- not good, so need to still test in the evening, and stay on top of it

tml english i was talking with someone yesterday and they relayed to me that they heard that most people do not know what an a1c test is, meaning they wouldn't know what their personal a1c is
my last a1c was 6.0
my a1c is is 6.5 does anyone no if there are home test for this
my a1c dropped to 4.9, but because i knew that sometimes my bloodsugars were in the 200s that should have been impossible
hi christine   i know that when i first found out that i was a diabetic, the doctors used to tell me i needed to get my a1c under 7 ,at that time it was 16, not good i know,  but now my a1c is 5,3 and i was told that i am doing fantastic, so as long as it is under 7 i think your doctor will say your doing fantastic cindy i agree

my a1c went from 13.8 when i was admitted to 7.6 three months later
my a1c is back in the 6's but i want to get it closer to 6.5 (now 6.9)
her a1c is below 6
hp    many of the type 2's on the newsgroup that gathered the information have achieved an a1c below 6.0%, largely through changing their diets in addition to medicines and exercise
my a1c is 6.2 - 6.3 regularly, so it does help
through my own diet and exercise scheme, i lost 60 pounds of body weight, blood sugars dropped quite a bit, and got my a1c down from 6.8 to 5.3 in 9 months - all without a single medication
my a1c then was 15.9
when i was admitted to the hospital last month, the er dr said that my a1c was close to 16

this spring, for many reasons, i chose to take control, with an a1c over 12, and weight pushing close to 300lbs, i am making the changes in my life to control my diabetes
my a1c was over 11 two years ago; last week i discovered that i had managed to get it down to 9
were you to have your a1c somewhere &lt;6.5  my answer would be totally different but at this point you are at serious risk of complications and need to be making a 24/7 concerted effort to get this under control now
when i was first diagnosed in 2008 my a1c was above 10 and reading were over 600&hellip; i had them down in the high 100's then lost my job&hellip; with the medication and diet plan i am on now they were lower than before and have the last couple weeks reached normal reading and i had my first low of 65

my a1c from may 2011 was 5.5, and i have lost 40+ lbs since feb
until recently, i was able to keep my a1c's in the mid to low 6's which is considered good for a diabetic
i had to send away for it and decided that i might want to try to manage my diabetes with what i ate and avoided eating,  on that meal plan i maintained a bg (blood glucose) level in the normal range, achieved an a1c of 5.5, and lost 65 lbs over the course of 5 mo
i have struggled to lose 6 lbs and brought the a1c to 6.3
my a1c was below 7
my a1c was 10.5 then
my last a1c was 5.8, so i guess even then damage occurs
my a1c was 17 in november and last week it was down to 14
so congratulations again i can't wait until the day i get to a1c of 7 what excellent news
i learned so much about diabetes in the last 11 or so years &hellip; one thing i've learned is once a diabetic always a diabetic except gestational diabetes &hellip; if you are taking extraordinary steps to control your diabetes causing the symptoms to go into remission , that's awesome and i congratulate you &hellip; keep it up &hellip; also if you have gestational diabetes you will get diabetes one day&hellip;might not be right away well my doctors did because my a1c hasnt changed in many months, i have had diabetes for 12 years so am not stupid and yes i know it can maybe come back
after 46 years of type 1, i aim for a bg of 80 to 180 and end up with an a1c in the 6's

a1c from 10.6 down to 8.3, better but still bad
i started with an a1c of 11.7 and was 7.8 at my first retest
initially, this resulted in getting my a1c down to 5.9&hellip;but, it's slowly inched back up as i slackened on the carb control
lately my a1c has been  13 something crazy unhealthy
my a1c is 9.3
tml english hi everyone, was wondering, trying to stick to 3 med size meals instead of 5 little ones, and was wondering if fiber would help me or hurt me my a1c is 6,8 dw from 9 ,2 sugars been running 100 to 105  on a 7-14 day average, thank you everyone you must have fiber in your diet
my a1c was 12, my bg at the time i was tested was 385, and the urine came back with everything you'd expect from these kinds of numbers
my a1c's went from 12.6 to 10.6 and now 9.4
it worked, and i lowered my a1c to 5.5
4400-my-a1c-s-1980-2009
a1c's became available in 1976
my doctor started having his diabetic patients get a1c tests in 1980
i had no idea what a a1c was ,untile today ,bye reading about it today and i had a glus readding of 230 ,i never had a reading go so hight befor i was sick ,so when i saw the docter she tould what was my ac1 i had no idea what it was or anything
and my a1cs are still high, 8ish, so hoping i can rope them in better with the pump and cgm
in the last years the highest my a1c was 8.9 about 5 years ago and now i at about 6.9 i was very strict last year and got down to 5.6 i just got where i could not eat that small amount of crabs
when i was diagnosed i was told my a1c was 11.9 which i have learned is horrible
she and her staff told me over and over again how amazing to see my a1c drop to 7.6 in a little over 2 months
from that, i gained back the weight that i had lost, my a1c went from a beautifully controlled 5.7 (on metformin) to 7.5 and an increase in those meds
my a1c as of two days ago tested 5.9 after 6 months
i also had lost 40 pounds in 8 weeks when all this was going on and at my last check up in august my a1c had went from 12.1 in feb
i have been on byetta 4 months and my a1c has gone from 8.2 to 6.3
i'm hoping that i can get my a1c even lower over the next 3 months
i should also add that my a1c is 5.8 and my numbers are low between 80 - 140
my a1c went down to 5.7 this month but my cholesterol went up some so there is a trade off for me and it provided more info that will affect how i manage my d
my doc says my numbers are really high and i'm a ticking time bomb cause my a1c is 13.5
i was diagnosed type 2 in 2007 a1c has fluctuated between 10 and 13.5 since being diagnosed
if you believe the estimated average glucose charts your a1c range means your average blood sugar is in the 240-340 range
it was proven to me this summer, when i lost some weight and my hba1c went down to 5.4
may i suggest a meal plan (i dislike the word "diet") on which which i lost 65 lbs last year, had an a1c of 5.5, normalized my blood glucose (bg) readings and did it without resorting to diabetes meds of any kind
per his chart, an average of 90 over the 2 to 3 months covered by an a1c would translate to a 5 like locarb said
as you know, the a1c looks at your overall blood sugar levels, and since we can't test our blood sugar every few minutes throughout the day, the a1c gives a good overall picture of blood sugar management
bg of 90 "more or less" is a1c of 5.0 to 5.1
tml english i just received my result today my a1c is 6.2 my cholesterol is slightly elevated my hemoglobin is very low which is my worry my test says 11.0 and normal is 11.5-15.5g/dl hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen
my a1c is 6.4
from the information i have my a1c should be below 6.5
i was diagnosed a year ago with an a1c of 6.5
3 months later my next a1c was 5.8
the very best news is they ran my a1c when i went in for surgery last month and it came back at 5.8
i have kept my a1c below 7 at all cost and have managed to avoid problems all this time
my a1c is 6.7 and i really want to get it into the 5&#39;s gabby,  i remember researching the white kidney bean extract in response to a discussion question posted recently
i've chosen to limit my carbohydrate intake to 120 grams per day so that i can keep my a1c below 7
tml english hi  i was diagnosed 6 weeks ago , my dr did a random blood testing my sugar was 358 and then ordered a1c its 12.6
my last a1c was in the high 6's
we are trying to get her a1c levels under 10 and of course her father's neglect will reverse all our efforts in a short time
if your stepdaughter has an a1c above 10, im really concerned for her
its not like i can leave my house without it and ive had t1d for 8 years and only this year i reached my best ever achieved a1c of 7.5
her a1c1 is according to her okay and that is the way her doctors want it
my bride jem had a good a1c number too, even though she had blood glucose numbers as high as 300
and my a1c hovers around 5
tml english last august i was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes my a1c was 9.8
thru diet exercise and family support i am 60lbs lighter can wear my sons clothes and today got results from my yearly physical my a1c 6.3
like others here, i have been "controlled" with normal bg for over three years (a1c 5.2 to 5.5)
good luck:) similar situation as kirk - dropped over 100 lbs, changed my diet and my a1c has been 4.9-5.2 for the last 3 years and am not on meds
i am in a similar situation&hellip;lost a lot of weight&hellip;good excersize&hellip;lowered my a1c from 11.1 to 6.8
and my latest a1c received last week was 5.8 after using the continuous glucose sensor (have run around 6.2 to 6.5 in the past)
my a1c went from 7.9 to 7.0 and i've almost elimenated the need for short acting insulin
james gave you excellent information and i encourage you to talk with your doctor about your current a1c level, and also where she wants your a1c to be
an a1c below 7 is recommended to avoid potential complications of diabetes, but sometimes physicians have a different a1c goal for you depending on your individual situation
a1c is shortened version of "hemoglobin a1c" it is a test which tests a particular protein in the blood which gives an average of all the blood glucose (bg) readings for the past 90 days, weighted toward the most recent readings
the a1c used to be done through a blood test done in a dr's office or a lab, but recent years a personal a1c meter is available fo consumers using a meter and a strip, much like a glucometer
so the only way one can get an a1c reading, is through a blood test done through a dr's office, or through reading from an a1c meter
in june i was had a physical and a1c came back 7.4 - i was prescribed metformin 500 mg twice daily
i had a1c tested on november 19th and urine came back positive for microalbuminurea (kidney malfunction, could be earlier stage of kidney failure or kidney disease)
my a1c was 6.0
my last a1c was 5.5
good luck and great job getting your a1c down to 7.3
maybe i missed something but how did you know that my a1c was 7.3
i want to make a prediction, sometime in the future as the a1c threshold for diagnosing dm keep on getting lower (from 7.0 to 6.5 already, then 6.0,5.7,finally as low as 5.5), and people's dieting habits keep on getting worse, there will be as many as 1/3 - 1/2 of the population being diagnosed dm sometime in their lives
my last a1c was below 6
well, everyone here seems to be getting their a1c down to the low 5's with fasting
my a1c is at 9.9 so i have a lot of work to do to get it down
lots of interner hugs to everyone rhonda i strongly recommend the pump, my a1c went from 8.2 to 7.2 in like 3 months i would like to try the pump but i don't have any insurance
when i was diagnosed july 22, 2011 my a1c was 12.3, in october it was 7.6 and my new a1c is 5.6
somebody's been working very hard&hellip;big drop a1c5.6
i just saw my results online and my a1c is down from 6.1 to 5.8
my second (a1c) was 6.5 (diagnosed in may-type ii)
***  but again for me it is testing all day&hellip; keeping the bs level&hellip;  not what the a1c test says&hellip; but lol&hellip;a good a1c test does make me very happy
the neuropathy pain in my feet started with my a1c was 5.5 and my morning fasting were under 115&hellip; it was the over bs# of 200 (or more) i hit a few times a day that caused the damage
side note&hellip; i have seen it written as ac1 and a1c i think  the correct term is hba1c&hellip; any way it is a reading of your blood surgar over a 3 month period sort of a long term history
his a1c levels are 7.1
that's the average for my morning results my day/evening #'s are much better also i had my a1c checked yesterday and it was 7.6 :d i've gone from 11.3 to 7.6 in 5.5 months yay
my a1c has always been a 10 or above
tml english i'm having a real hard time getting this a1c down to 6%
i don't think in the 7 years since i was diagnosed with type 2, i have ever had my a1c at 6%
i found i needed to eliminate or greatly reduce my carbs and increase my exercise level&hellip;then i was able to get my a1c back into the 6's&hellip;6.6 in june, down from 7.1 in march
my a1c went down to 7.8 from 8.6 in 3 months
my doc tells me my a1c was 20 points higher than usual and this is after he upped my glucotrol xl 10 mg from 1 to 2 a day
tml english i found out this week that my a1c is 6.2
are experts those with an a1c below 6.5
i am slowly lowering a1c going slowly went from 9.1 to 7.5 last time hopefully down futher on oct
correlation of a1c% to actual blood sugar   4- 60 5- 90 6- 120 7- 150 8- 180 9- 210 10- 240 11- 270 12- 300 13- 330   what do you all think of this
i have worked very hard to get my a1c down to 6.2 but i have also paid a very high price health wise to get there
i usually test "normal" but my a1c has gone from 6.5 to 6.8 with no real alteration to my lifestyle
however, an a1c of 9 or better, yes, now it's time to get a whole lot more serous
i had developed a meal plan where i stopped my twice daily injections of nph insulin, kept my bg (blood glucose) in the 80 to 130 mg/dl range and achieve an a1c of 5.5% and lose 65 lbs over a 5 mo period
i would love to get my a1c down to below 8
during that time i have lost 110 pounds and kept my a1c below 5
i once knew a young lady that was diagnosed adult onset type 1, and she kept on taking her insulin on an empty stomach, or when she had very very little to eat&hellip;i know this probably does not apply to you, but i am still astounded at what happened to her&hellip;after taking her insulin with no food in her, or very little food for a whole year, her a1c fell to a 3.3
she went from an a1c of 10plus to 3.3 in a year
msann's bg is very low, but i was responding to your commnet about your friend&mdash;where you stated in the previous paragraph, "she went from an a1c of 10plus to 3.3 in a year
and will it greatly affect my a1c to be high for 3 hrs every once in a while
however, when i was first diagnosed my a1c was 7.8
until 2012, my a1c was an average of 6.3
i eat whatever i want and my last a1c was high, and that was a 6.2; it's all about how you approach your disorder
it isn't your a1c that is high for 3 hours it is your blood sugar and yes it will have an affect on you
lost 70 lbs since april 2013 &amp; my a1c went from 13.2 to 5.3 during the first 3 months after diagnosis
tml english my a1c this time was a 5.5 guys
primary said with my constant numbers and current a1c of 6.0, i do not need the tablets
my a1c went from 14.1 to 5.9 in less than 4 months
y blood sugar a1c was 6.2  week ago taking only 500mg metformin in morn unless  b
my last hba1c was 6.9&hellip;i'm working to get it back into the mid 6's
thank u hooray for you&hellip;  i just got back from the dr and my a1c once again was 5.6&hellip; yea for the low carb diets&hellip; he has taken me off all meds for the next 6 weeks and i will renew the blood work and see if i can really and truely say i am not diabetic&hellip; happy dance happy dance *\o/* good a1c *\o/* thanks
a1c is 5,1 to 5.3, my bg runs about 98 to 118 with spikes of 143
my a1c was 5.4 last month
i have been on it for almost a year and doing very well, last a1c was 5.6 and along with diet and exercise have lost 29lbs and maintaining my goal weight
but he said my a1c was 5.9&hellip;nice
my last a1c was 6.8
my last a1c was 6.7
my blood work was really good, and a1c was 6.1, which was down from last test which was 6.5
my a1c was 6.8 the dr gave me 3 months then we reevaluate my test results
it's like the military,  hurry up and wait thankfully the blood isn't as bad as it was but it's still there&hellip; my a1c is down to 7 since they upped my meds 2000 mg met- 8mg glimpirde (sp) and injections at night 13 units
she had previously had 2 finger stick type a1c tests done and her results were 5.0 and 5.9 from those tests
the blood draw a1c showed it at 6.2
my last a1c was a 7.1 so i wonder what it will be now
my latest a1c is 5.5, and over the past year i have lost 65 lbs
i had my a1c test done (5.8)
i am still waiting on an a1c below 8&hellip;maybe soon
my last a1c was 6.9 and i'd like to get it lower which means i'll most likely have to cut down on my daily carbs and/or increase my exercise level&hellip;living with diabetes is a constant challenge and balancing act
if you understand the physiology, you know that not achieving the goal of an a1c below the 7's, is very bad
in three months my a1c went from a 6.0 to a 9.7 :(   what did i do wrong
tml english my latest a1c was 6.4
with an a1c of 6.5 you would be considered well controlled
my last a1c was 5.7
i've found that for me, i can keep my a1c's below 7.0, and maintain my weight at 120 lbs by limiting my daily carbs to no more than 120 grams
it kept my bg levels generally between 80 and 130, lowered my a1c to 5.5, and i lost about 65 lbs within about 10 months on my experemental eating plan
fp=162mg/dl pp2=198mg/dl hba1c=10.3%, a big surprise for me, as nobody want to be a diabetic, and i was one of them
concentrated on weight reduction (reduced to 68kg from 80kg within one month without cutting my normal diet) after one month my hba1c was 7.2%
my latest status (14 feb 15) is: fp = 85mg/dl pp2 = 90mg/dl hba1c = 5.7% please advise me if i am on right track
hank god,my a1c was 6
anything under an hba1c of 7 is indicative of good control
without knowing your history and experience with your endo, had your prior a1c been 11 and your current one 9, the endo might have been happy with your progress but there still a need for improvement
the a1c came back at 7.2 and my pancreas is fine
my a1c is at 13.12 my doc said that was more than double what she wants it to be
but ya i wish you the best of luck i was diagnosed with an a1c at 14+ i was almost in a coma because i was sooo sick with ketoacidosis
ive lowered my a1c from 9 to 6 and went from 2 insulins and 2 oral anti diabetics to one each, so i know how you feel
i mean i'm only sixteen and i've had diabetes for 13 years and right now my a1c is 13.1
my a1c doesn't hardly go above 6
i commend you on keeping your a1c under 6 for so many years &hellip; at this point you are a professional diabetic champion defeater
wow your a1c sounds great, mine was 5.9 last time, because of too many lows
tml english my a1c was 6.6 last time i went in to my doctors and now it is 6.9
told her i am in control, my a1c 5.6 been there for two years, im not coming back in three months and i will see them in six months
sounds fantastic, esp the a1c # great a1c
i was told that keeping tight control of your blood glucose helps but my a1c has been under 6 since before i developed neuropathy so i am at a loss here
my a1c was 12.6 in december and i am totally insulin dependent
he says he doesn't want the extra site even though his a1c every 3 months has been going up
it has been such a beneficial tool for me and keeping my a1c at 5.6 where it has been since my pregnancy in 2014 with my daughter
don't let the a1c scare you, it's just an average of the past 3 months bs, it gets easier, go on line and research the disease
om/a1c_hba1c_kidneyscree
tml english i took an at home a1c test today&hellip;the same brand that i have used twice before&hellip;my a1c both times tested 4.9&hellip;but when i went to the doctor it tested 5.0&hellip;so this test seems to be cosistantly   .1 under my doctor's test&hellip;anyway i tested&hellip;drum roll please&hellip;4.7&hellip;so if it holds true and is .1 under my doctor's test
still adjusting but my last a1c was 5.5
finally a few weeks ago, i had an a1c of 11 again
i'm on track for an a1c of about 8 in the next few months
i like keeping my a1c in control so i don't eat the carbs (my last a1c was 5.5) its all about individual tolerance
as a non-insulin dependent type 2 my goal is to get my a1c to under 5.0 (ultimately) and to be off all meds controlling my diabetes through diet and exercise
it helped me get my a1c from 15 to 5.8 but this also included a diet change and increased exercise
i was dianogsed 26 months ago, and i have no idea how long i had it, just that the doctor said it was caught 'early' i asked her how they knew it was caught early, and she said because my a1c was 5.6 and i am interested in reversing, but while i am doing real well, i have not reversed it yet
14978-a1c-for-diabetics-should-be-over-7-0
tml english my long term a1c tests have me in the 6.0 to 6.6 range
my doctor ups my visits to every 3 months if my a1c is over 7
i would think that a more normal a1c such as in the 5&#39;s or 6&#39;s would be ideal unless you are doing it by having too many low episodes
my a1c is 6.6, doc thinks this is great; however as a t1 i continue to experience lows, which like carol said can be dangerous
i will be trying this out this week, i want my a1c lower than 6.6, so am hesitating to lower meds, but also sometimes feel like i am constantly eating to avoid lows
your a1c is really good, i'm trying to get mine below 6.8
my last a1c is 5.5 by just what i eat and excercise
i'm usually 80-125 also by my a1c (last check) was 4.9
24, please cross your fingers i'm hoping things have changed big time:) my last a1c was 11 and my bs was 452 when i first was diagonosed
my a1c was at 12.4
only being diagnosed with type 1 for 5 months now, and only on lantus (long lasting insulin 10 u in am &amp; 10 u in pm) my first ever a1c results were 5.8% yay
i am 49 and type 2 and my a1c 7.2  i am on levemir 21 units at bed time  and that is long acting to ,i know that i need to get mine down
my a1c is 5.6 but my doctor says full blown diabetes
i had barely failed the 2 hr glucose test with a 205 &amp; 210, had fastings in upper 70 to lower 80 and hga1c of 5.4
my a1c was at 6.8
and as of last month the dr has taken me off all diabetic meds&hellip; 1 full years of a1c of 5.6 or less  yea
my a1c is 5.5 last may
my a1c was 6.9 but with all the lows i have been having i know that is not a true reading
i am a mother of 5 my 4 year old daughter has type 1 she was diagnosed april 14 2009 we had her on the pump by nov 1 2009 i love it she does really well with her bgs i keep in contact with her drs every week to see if we need to make adjustments to her basal icr all that i just took her to the dr last week her a1c was 7.1 so she is doing really good we only have a few lows during the month it took a little while to get it down but im so glad we arent doing the shots anymore she was up to 7 shots a day before we started using the pump but it would be something to look into for sure hello there
i went from having an a1c of 11% to now close to my goal at 7%
my a1c was 13.6 now in three months it's down to 10.3 and getting better readings in the daytime now
his a1c is 10.8 and his bg is around 200 or so
tml english found out today that my a1c is down to 6.1
i started this journey with an a1c of 11.4 on december 30th, 2009 and today, march 30th, 2010 my a1c is 8.1
now of course, i'm not entirely thrilled with this number as i figured all my efforts should have resulted in an a1c under 7, but even as my physician said, this is still new for me, and it will still take some time/medication/diet/exercise and the magical combination thereof for me to hit my mark&hellip;but i will do it
my a1c are 5.5 or less for three years
my a1c went from 10.3 to now 6.2   diabetes has been easier to accept than my chronic pelvic pain
my a1c was just 1 tenth of a point below tha diabetic level
over the next 3 months i brought my a1c down 2 tenths of a point and lost 20 pounds
i am not overweight, a1c was 5.7 and glucose was 102, but t2 killed my mom and my sister is diabetic too
she ran lots of blood work, my a1c was 14.5, and last week she started me on insulin
i am not sure how much to worry about the healing process because i&#39;ve never had a problem healing from other more &#39;natural&#39; injuries, even with a less-than-stellar a1c and 15 years of type 1
during 2010, my hba1c crept up over 7 and my gp kept on upping my lantus (to 20u) which i was taking in the evening
testing is key and aim for 80 to 180 bg which usually ends up with an a1c of 6.5
my last a1c was last week and it is 5.9
this month my a1c was 5.7
my a1c was 6.3
an a1c of 6.3, congratulations
i am hopeful to see the labs down and an a1c less than 10 as it started at 14.1
started with a a1c of 14.1 changed my diet and went to 5.9 in about 4 months
last a1c was 5.9,  it has been almost 6 months
won't get an a1c for 2 months so hoping its good
here's to a1c numbers that will please you in 2 months
, here's to good numbers (a1c) on the 18th of july
my last a1c was 5.5
i don't think i had an a1c so low since before i was dx'd in 1995
just found out my a1c was 7.5 - anyone know what this means
i have an a1c done every 6 weeks and it can fluctate from 5.0 to 10.0 and anywhere in between&hellip; sigh   i know if i stay away from sugar it's not so bad
i was diagnosed a year ago with an a1c of 6.5
punkiedoo a1c test has a error range of about 0.5%
that is if you were tested as 6.5% your actual a1c might be 6% -7%
i'm quite sure my a1c was accurate at 6.5
radically change my eating, exercised religiously and one month later no glucose in my urine, a1c was 6.4
my two subsequent a1c were 4.8 and 5
it was the a1c and the fact that bs was 180 when i came to the doc that first time with the headaches and the 200/120
tml english my diabetes is normally well controlled with my last two a1c being 4.8 and 5.0 respectively
last hgba1c was 7.3 and started on metformin
15345-is-anyone-tested-for-the-a1c-more-often-than-every-90-days
tml english i have low a1c under 6 but have very high blood sugar even my fasting blood sugars, over 200 is normal for me
i have had the fruitose test and that seems within range   has anyone been tested for the a1c more often than every 90 days
if the 200s are accurate readings, you also have to be having some really low bgs at times when you aren't testing to get and a1c under 6
by contrast, the a1c is protected from outside influences because of the serile blood draw (when done by the doctor or lab), so you get a real look at what's happening to your blood cells over the previous 3 months
my a1c went from 8.9 to 6.2 and my sugar pretty well stays under 150 for the most part
right now, i am taking metformin 500mg 2x a day but my a1c is still going in the wrong direction (as of 6/14 it was 7.3)
my type ii a1c is down to 5.5 as of last week&hellip;but my blood pressure and bad cholesterol are up and now i've got to take meds for that too
through classes i learned that in our bodies&hellip;the protein attaches to the carbs and helps take them out of our bodies thus helping fewer carbs to be absorbed&hellip;and raising our blood sugar level&hellip;it really has worked for me and i have lost 22lbs in the past 5/6 months (and i didn't starve or feel deprived)&hellip;and my recent a1c was 6.0
i've finally been zeroing in on things that work using that approach&hellip;latest a1c is down to 5.5 this week&hellip; i've finally got some good results
i think he/she checked there blood and the readin was 20 not the a1c sorry meant to put that on your other comment what's 20&hellip;your a1c
i kept my a1c around 5.5 to 6 during my pregnancy and i ended up with an absolutely perfect baby boy
i am praying for you and your child   blessings to you and yours   james feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
that doesn't  give me a lot of "wiggle room" but my last a1c was 5.3, so i guess i will try to stick with it
my a1c levels are usually in the low 5's
the new criteria for diabetes according to the american diabetes association is based on:   a1c greater than or equal to 6.5%   fasting plasma glucose greater than or equal to 126 mg/dl   greater than or equal to 200 mg/dl after consuming 75 grams of glucose   a random plasma glucose test with results of greater than or equal to 200 mg/dl   i would assume the criteria for pre-diabetes may have changed and should be available through the american diabetes association
we&#39;ve never used one as we get an a1c test at each clinic appointment (every 3 months)
john, hi i'm trisha, i don't mean to sound dumb, but what is a1c test trisha, an a1c is an average of you're blood glucose levels over a period of time
then once my a1c results came back they said 1,600 calorie
but after 3 months of no meds my a1c was 10.9
i do not have high blood pressure and my hgba1c is usually at 7.0 this time it was 8.0
if you can get your a1c level at or below 6% it would be good
(i had an a1c of 5.5 for quite a while by following a specific meal plan
i started on this low carb diet after reading dr richard bernstein's "diabetes solution"&hellip;got my a1c's back into the 6's until recently and lost 10 pounds by avoiding the carbs to&hellip;a win/win
i know a few people have manage to reverse the damage neuropathy caused by keeping their a1c at very low level like 5.0&hellip;i know it is a lot of work, but maybe worth it&hellip;what is your a1c now
my a1c is 5.6 which isn't bad, dr thinks neroptahy damage of the feet and legs started when i was a prediabetic for so long
if i were you i would drive my a1c to 5.0 or lower, there is nothing to lose&hellip;you wanna do this before damage become permanent, the longer you wait, the less fully you can recover
that, along with my basal and bolus insulins, resulted in my having a1c's below 6.0 soon after the start of the new century
my a1c's before the mid 1990s were much much higher
since i started on this eating plan in feb 2011 my bg readings have been in the "normal" range, my may a1c was 5.5, and to date in august 2011 i have lost about 50 lbs
cde   "overall diabetes control is based on the a1c, which is an average of approximately 3 months worth of blood sugars that includes the extreme highs and lows
her a1c was over 12 at one point, but she has been able to get it down quite a bit by just changing how she eats carbs
i have in the last year, manitained my bg levels in the "normal" range, my a1c was 5.5, and i lost 65 lbs
today been kinda down about my d these last few weeks but&hellip; my a1c is 6.4 down from 6.6 down from 7.9 lost 13lb for a total of 23lb since april so to day is a good good day&hellip; *\o/*                     *\o/*                   *\o/*                 *\o/*             *\o/* jodi i'll say it'sa good day 1 congratulation smommafish 1 fantastick
you have done well getting your a1c down from 7.9 to 6.4
thats a good idea my bg this morning was 84 i have a new doctor and he warn me about my a1c mine is at the moment is 10.4 way to high so he has me keeping a log of everything i eat and the times also i am testing more
my a1c was still at a 6.9, but i still felt crappy from the inconsistency
a1c is a 3 to 4 month average of your blood glucose
no not on insulin just taking 2 gliclazide a day jigsaw cant do a1c yet as only been diagnosed 2 and bit months should be due blood test soon so will ask gp xxx
i have had a 5.6 a1c for the last 6 months and my doctor has not taken me off any thing
so an uncontrolled diabetic is where you can't keep your sugar in the range that the doctors were set, but in the last 5 to 10 yrs, they started using a1c, all recommendations are it around 6
my a1c  is 5.1 and i am not on any insulin or pills
i had kept my bg  levels in the normal range (80 to 130 mg/dl) achieved an a1c of 5.5, lost 65 lbs over the course of 5 mo, all the while discontinuing any diabetes medications (nph insulin)
yet about 3 yrs ago i decided to try a new way of managing my diabetes which resulted in keeping my bg levels in the normal range (80 to 130 mg/dl) achieving an a1c of 5.5, loss of 65 lbs  of fat over the course of 5 months
and it ssmall nobody bwill ever know you have it on and ytou can take it off for tow hrs ect&hellip; its so much better then shooting your self up plus ytour a1c leveles will be better think about it im 33 still young i go out drink ect&hellip; but evrything is managable with the pump what we do want is for melissa is to live  and what we do not want is to promote her life threatening life style
upload pic of pump to pics check it out if you want more info you can ask if you want ill give my number if you want look its the best thing that happend i used to shoot up about 16 times a day my a1c leves used to be 17 once i got on the pump my numbers droped you see results right away and all insurences pay for pumps i know alot with this anyway good luck if anything you can ask what ever done alot now on the right path k bye hey guys&hellip; don't worry about me&hellip; i know i can not do this on my own and i'm heading to detox soon
my a1c  6 weeks ago was 6.5 my doctor agrees that that if it keeps going down we will drop the met and cut back on the units of insulin
the bottom line is control, and keeping that a1c in the 6's
i agree with you 100%, i have heard  people say insulin is the end of the line but it really isn't&hellip;my a1c has went from around 10 to 5.8
my bg although high at times along the learning curve, rarely peaked above 140, and my a1c has always been 6.0 to 6.2
if your a1c is 6 or less, you're fine
james baker   (latest a1c is 5.5) wow
tml english after being here in arizona for about 10 wks now &mdash; my inflammation is down big time even tho the locals say the humidity here has been higher than ever during that time period &mdash; my glucoma is gone &mdash; yes &mdash; gone &mdash; i have cut my narcotic pain killers more than 2/3 of what i was taking each day &mdash; my a1c is 6.2 &mdash; from 8.4 last yr &mdash; not losing anymore weight just now &mdash; but that's next &mdash; somehow i have reached a plateau&mdash; however still from spt to oct i did lose 2 lbs &mdash; sigh &mdash; but with all these good things going on in my body
i can deal with it &mdash; there are plenty beautiful pictures on fb and pinterest so i can just look at those &mdash;  soooo i am just thrilled and intend to keep on bringing down my a1c and getting my bp down even more&mdash; altho that is better also &mdash;has been running about 130-137 over 82-87 &mdash; so i can kick too hard about that &mdash; so glad things are working for you
tml english hey every one just got my a1c level back &hellip; and i'm 4.1 just wanted to know what's your guys last one was&hellip; or even if u wanna share your worst and best a1c &hellip;just wanna know a little about all of y'all&hellip; :) at diagnosis 4 years ago my a1c was 11.4
my most recent a1c was 6.2
my a1c is 6.2, still on meds &amp; try hard to keep it regulated
i've been diabetic since jan 2010 my first aic  was 13%  my second 8.9% my a1cm was 7
my a1c is 6.2 my last one was 7.4 it has gone down since i started exercising the time before that was 9.3 mine was 6.2, my doctor is satisfied with it, but i would like to see it lower myself
that drugs has a great side effect increases appetite&hellip;lol mayo clinic staff for someone who doesn't have diabetes, a normal a1c level can range from 4.5 to 6 percent
someone who's had uncontrolled diabetes for a long time might have an a1c level above 8 percent
a1c level of 6.5 percent or higher on two separate tests indicates you have diabetes
for most people who have previously diagnosed diabetes, an a1c level of 7 percent or less is a common treatment target
a new study shows increased risk of heart attacks for people with a1c below 6
a 4.1 a1c averages out to be about a 70 (mg/dl) which on some scales is considered "optimal"
my last a1c (may 2013) was 6.7
my lowest a1c was 5.9 back in 2004 when i was on mdi (mutiple daily injections) of lantus and novolog
"lowest" should say: later, cathy you a1c is 4.1&hellip; that's amazing
normal human glucose/a1c levels: 4.3 - 5.5 % (70 - 108 mg/dl) a1c level of 5.6 - 5.9% blood glucose has exceeded the normal upper limit of the assay range, indicating an abnormality in the expected normal human range
an a1c level of 6.0% or greater represents a high risk for diabetes mellitus
your a1c is a 3 month test to check blood sugar levels in your body over a period of time
i was diagnosed 2 yrs ago, and it took awhile to see change but i have gone from 11 a1c, to as low as 5.6, and now at about 6.3, so like monica said, it does get better
so today when i got the mail i was so happy when i saw that my a1c was 5.5
great a1c just keep working at keeping it under 7.0
awesome a1c 5.5&hellip;you are doing great
a1c was 4 last test and have been below 5 since the operation
but he wants to see me get my a1c below 6.5 before checking
my hga1c has always been between 5.2 and 5.9 for the past 8 years, but they could not even diagnose me as a diabetic by doing the a1c
also i don't know what you consider a "good" a1c  but for quite a while mine was 5.5 (which i consider good) and my neuropathy continued unchanged
the neurologist said i should keep my a1c below 6 and start and exercise program (hoping to get some physical therapy set up when i next see my primary care
my a1c was 6.2 but&hellip;my potassium was off the charts high
i got my a1c down from 6.5 to 6.2 in 6 weeks
i just got back from my doctor and my a1c went from a 7.2 to 5.5
congratulations&hellip;that is very exciting news to hear you dropped from a1c 7.2 to 5.5&hellip;lots of hard work behind this&hellip;you should be very proud of yourself, i know i am for you&hellip; thank you mewella
my a1c when i was diagnosed was 8.7 and now i have it down to 7.5 its not much but i just feel like giving up
i brought my last a1c from 10.9%-11% all the way to a whopping 8.3% (8% overall)
saves a lot of energy for searching on google&hellip; every bit helps in finding an endo, my insurance required a referral from my primary care physician and i actually had to threaten to fire my pcp when he told me my bg levels were "not that bad" while hovering around 200+ in a fasting state after years of oral meds, exercise, low carbs &hellip; nada nada (keep in mind when first diagnosed in 2002 my a1c was almost 15 and bg was over 600, so i worked at getting it lower for years
it was worth the wait and the fight to get to see one as i have finally over the past 2 years since working with one got life back to normal and a1c staying below 6
sometimes you have to choose to go without something else to have what matters look at the price of test stripes  dexcom cut that price down it helps pay for its self i have to agree that a lenses when having hypo or hyper would only make me more uncomfortable and hard to handle while trembling i also i don't get the google bit in the discussion but germany did have a glucose watch in 2003 and we almost went international just to get control of my brittle type 2 years later i got the dexcom g4 and it brought my a1c from an 8.4 to a 6.3 in three months my  enderclunalgist  ( can't spell it but y'all get it ) said it was the lowest it had ever been in 10 year of seeing me ever three months
tml english all of my blood work came back high again my triglycerides are in the 400's and my a1c started to go up again it was 5.8 and now it is 6.1
i have maintained an a1c around 6.0 for the last twenty years, and i have never felt better
and there is no greater reward than that&hellip;my a1c is 5&hellip;5&hellip;and guess what my diabetes hasn't gone away&hellip;i have it in a nice box with a ribbon&hellip;everything is all dressed up and looks pretty&hellip;but i still have diabetes&hellip;it will never go away&hellip;and a very big part of me doesn't want it to&hellip;because i am taking such good care of myself and i look so flipping good that i like who i am&hellip;granted
the main objective to stay healthy is to maintain an a1c in the 6's and maintain a body weight somewhere near where you should be
;dr atkins proved it in many cases, and i proved it to myself&hellip;152 last check with an a1c of 6.7&hellip;plus you're losing weight (fat) in the process
goal is to get a1c below 6 by end of year
wtg getting your a1c down to 7.2
i do not feel too bad for all the participation i have taken in my husbands' health care, because his 3 months results were fantastic; his a1c went from 9.9 to 6.9, and his bs, chlorestals, tsh levels, blood pressure, everything was within normal levels
after 2 of them a1c was at 11.7 my experience with steroid shots (had them for a torn rotator cuff) is that they tend to elevate your bgl for about a week
not sure your a1c would be greatly affected as it is measuring the glycated hemoglobin in the red blood cells over a 2 - 3 month period
an a1c of 11.7 indicates average blood glucose levels of over 300 &hellip; dangerous and certainly in the range that will cause complications
2111-why-does-the-ada-say-an-a1c-of-7-0-or-less-is-good
tml english my doctor wants my a1c below 6.0 since that is a nondiabetic level
(3) but by far the most important reason is this: a vast majority of t2 people have a1c values far, far above 7.0, and ada has decided not to set the bar so high that nearly everybody fails to reach it
if you read your lab reports, you will see that a non-diabetic patient a1c is 4.8-5.9
my last a1c was 6.9 and my doctor and i were thrilled because it has taken along time to get there
i only test once a day (unless i'm sick) but seldom hit 130 and my a1cs run 6.0
my a1c started coming down and would actually register, at that time it was 13 which is not good but better
as if today my a1c is down to 8.1 and my doctor keeps adjusting my insulin
my a1c has been 6.9 the last 6 months
your 9 is your a1c and 6.5 is when my doc starts treating his wife is diabetic and he has been treating for years and has good rep with diabetic treatment
my last a1c level was 11
the "9" you're talking about if your a1c results, the average blood sugar over a 3 month period
my a1c is 6.3-6.5 so i don't get insane highs and i believe the highs that i do get are in the middle of the night when i am not aware of them because when i test i am just "normal high
when i was diagnosed i had an a1c of 15 and regularly had bg's over 500
when i was diagnosed w/t2 diabetes 16 yrs ago my a1c was at a 16 and i was 200lbs over weight
my a1c is now at an 8 which i'm not to happy about
my a1c at diagnosis was 14.7 (vs your 9) and my blood sugar was &gt;600
on that diet, my blood sugar was not in control, so i went low-carb (no grains, rice, potatoes, cereal, sugars, fruit except berries, starchy veggies like corn, milk) and eat plenty of meat, fish, eggs, cheese, nuts, veggies, cream, healthy oils (olive, coconut, avocados) - and my last a1c was 5.6, my fastings are usually under 100, i've lost almost 50 lbs, and i'm on metformin extended release but no insulin
probably the 9 is a hemoglobin a1c number (often referred to simply as "a1c")
the normal a1c for a person without diabetes is somewhere between 4 and 6
my a1c is awful, the highest it has ever been, at a 12.6
i'm currently trying to bring my a1c dow from a little over 11&hellip; um no
i have since controlled my bg and my a1c for the has been 6.0 today, there is no douth that i am diabetic even if i test in the normal ranges
not without medicine and not without watching what i eat though have they checked your a1c level, this tells what your blood sugar has been doing for the past 3 months
my wife has diabetes because her pancrease was removed at about 3 weeks old that part the doc's had nothing to do with however later on she had extremly high blood sugars and her a1c has always been between 7.4 and 15.0 and the doc;s never did anything about it except for moving around her insulins but months later when they saw that did not help they stoped treating her for the high's and when i as the husband and legal guardian asked about an insulin pump we were told no so i fired the first doc and got another and the same thing happened and he got fired to now we are on the third doc and i may have to fire her to oh and i forgot along with the gastroparesis she has because of the high blood sugars she also has diabetic nueropothy wonderful isn't it danielle's nuero increased her nuerontin from 600 to 900 three times a day and she's not herself anymore she sleeps alot i spoke to the insurance company about trying a cgms and the ins
a1c( 3 month average between6.0-7.0
my last a1c was 5.4
joni, an a1c of 5.4 is good
a1c for a non diabetic is usually 4-5
i leave room in my diet for an occasioanl "sugary" item as a treat and my a1c is 6.3 so for me my approach is working
i am pretty sure i would be much better off today had i been made aware that a more aggressive approach may have been more appropriate (or even possible) rather than the standard "cut down on the sugar, eat 150 grams of carbs per day, get your a1c under 7 and you will be fine" bs that it seems the vast majority of physicians are dispensing
my first a1c was 6.5
tml english hey guys got lab work back wed a1c down to 7.6 i am back on right track ,also all other numbers came down also ,keep me in your prayers have great day congratulations
i am no longet take  any type of medication for my diabetes and my last a1c was 5.1
tml english one year ago, i checked my blood sugar for no reason and the a1c was 5.7, fasting 103
went on a low carb very high protein diet and intense exercise,  a1c now 5.4, but fasting 105
a1c 5.8 and lost 14 lbs since november
congratulations on your a1c, that is great and the smoke free is on it&#39;s way
my a1c's are in the 6's
my a1c's are in the 6's
i've had good luck and had my third consecutive a1c at 5.6 or lower
when i was first diagnosed my a1c was 14
tml english so my hema1c was 7.0 fasting blood sugar 158
tml english i was on januva since july, 2007 and my diabetes was in excellent control my a1c's were always 5.6 and under ,
the one i could take onglyza my numbers sky rocketed where my a1c's are now 6.9 ,
i've been able to keep my hba1c levels in the 6's and maintain my weight at 120 lbs (i'm 5'3' tall, 65 years old, moderately active and female)
ent from and a1c of 6.5 to 6.9
my a1c was 11.1 which is a daily average of 310
i usually eat between 8 to 12 carbs per meal and snack, my a1c is usually around 5.7 to 5.8
i am on 3 oral meds and 1 injection of lantus per day, and my last a1c was 5.9, which my doctor said was to low
both parents were type2 so i should not be surprised&hellip;i was careful - i exercised, ate fairly healthy but another medical problem caused me to be put on a bland all carb and protein diet- thus making my a1c 7.1
a1c of 6 is when he starts meds
i also with that meal plan had discontinued my  twice daily nph injection, kept my bg (blood glucose) between 80 to 130 mg/dl, achieve an a1c of 5.5%, i offer my meal plan to anyone who asks for it
tml english hey guys had yearly physical thursday ,everything looking better, nurse called me back a1c down to 7.8 now it was 7.9 dont have to go back until nov, i am back on track now, got to excercise more, food intake a whle lot better, have great day right on
i am a very brittle diabetic, and for some reason or another am struggling to raise my a1c&hellip;don't know why, but it sits too low for the last 6 months to a year&mdash;-does anybody have any suggestions as to how to raise my a1c
i get keytones with extreme highs, almost admitted for ketoacidosis several times&mdash;-i go to the hospital a year and a half ago&mdash;they took my a1c, said it was 16, and i had keytones
now, my a1c is 5.8&mdash;-too low for me&mdash;-weird, very very weird&hellip;am i not eating enough carbs
very very frustrating&mdash;i feel my best at an a1c of 7&hellip;if anybody can help me, please write&mdash;-ha&mdash;-sorry to sound selfish&mdash;-i don't mean to&mdash;&mdash;-sincerely, anne are you on any meds to lower the cholesterol and triglycerides
your a1c number gives your average blood glucose for the past 3 months
anyway, i mentioned that i would  just rather take a higher dose of glymiperide&hellip;which i was on previously&hellip;but she said that  my a1c was down 5 points and i should stay on the levemir
i began see a new doctor recently since my a1c was 9 and he began treating me aggressively
a1c @ dx (10-2010:  11.4 last a1c (10-1-14):  7.3 lowest a1c (7-13):  5.8 thank you for sharing
my last a1c was 5.7 down from 6.6 and yesterday morning my fasting level was 93 and today was 102
he then went an entire 2 years, no insulin, his a1c was low, then after the 2 years, the a1c came back up to about 6.3
my last a1c was 6.8
i had a hard time conceiving when my a1c was 10-11% but in less than a years time i brought it down to 8% when i unexpectedly got pregnant and having been on insulin pump therapy now for 11/2 months i have brought it down to 6.7%
with insulin a1c last time was 6.8 you know the risk its up to you ,is it worth it to you to take that risk
a year ago, my a1c was 5% and fasting bg 90
his year (last week) a1c lowered to 4.8% and fasting bg jumped  to 136
yet during that same time period she achieved an a1c of 6
when i asked her endo about the seeming disconnect between her good a1c and her high daily bg readings he reminded me that an a1c is an average of all the bg levels (tested or untested) over a 90 day period
my a1c is 4.8 and i am cutting my metformin from 1000 twice daily to 500
if my a1c is still good after two months the metformin will be cut to 250 twice daily
i would love to get my a1c below 6 and so far i can't even do that on 2000mg metformin daily
i can't imagine an a1c below 5
my a1c has been 7.5 for many years
if your a1c is 4.8, you should be able to do it with  a very low carb diet
my a1c was 9 and the dr
he (the endo) stated that since my a1c was down below 6.0 now, that i really only needed to test once or twice a day
i do low carb to and some people just like to fuss keep on testing i got my a1c to 5.4 low carbing so you keep on going girl thanks i wll
my a1c was 9.5 in march 2012 and in november of 2012, it was down to 7.1
an a1c test is a blood draw test that tests the glucose range over the past 3 months usually, it gives a percentage as the answer such as 6.6% rather than a whole number like a gtt (glucose tolerance test) does
an a1c test is a test i get every 3 mons to give my endos  a sign if i am (cheating) i call it or not
i have brought my a1c down to the low to mid 6's since being diagnosed, and have lost over 20 lbs
tml english i went to my pcp this morning and recieved my first a1c of 6.2, i have lost 11 pounds lbs since diagnosis and she lowered my bp medication today
i have been on the shots for two months now,  my a1c when i got on the shots was 10.9 and two months after shots my a1c was 6.9
i think my a1c was somewhere in the 8s this time last year and at my last check-up it was 9.1&hellip;ugh
i've been on the omnipod since october - my a1c dropped .2 in the first month
but my problem is a1c lowest i every got was 8.0, 30 stress filled days later was back to 9.2
my a1c went from 10.8 to 6.4 in about 2 months (i was 10.1, got the sensor a month later, and the next a1c was 6.4)
some things that have helped me improve my a1c using a pump:   1
o the doctor sets up these classes to go to and gave me insulin to take but he didnt give me needles and they canceled the class so my a1c was 8.9 and i still havent gotten any meds to help so must be they dont care about it to much
my a1c was 13 when i was diagnosed and i felt really really sick
i'm type 1 and i know my a1c is like 12
my a1c was 10.86 but im trying to get it down under 7.0 i wasn't inquiring about your a1c, but was asking about the range your bg readings were running
cholesterol total: 208 triglycerides: 142 hdl cholesterol: 37 a1c: 11.4 i know, it's bad
my a1c was 8.9 and now is 6.5
that menu has been keeping my bgs in the normal range, and my last a1c in may was 5.5
drinking this and being good on my other stuff has helped me go from a 10.5 a1c to a 6.1 and four months and shed some of those extra pounds
my last a1c was 6.9 i think
since having the baby i am 21 lbs lighter than i was when i got pregnant and my a1c is now a 13.8
:) i was never really determined to do well with my t1diabetes until my last a1c came back 11 i knew it was time to get it together sorry about your feet hurting but when an amazing job you have done
his a1c`s went from a 9 to a 7 in just 2 months after starting on the water
a nurse told me my a1c a few yrs ago and said i as in like a remission but i would not always stay that way well i have for a few yrs now at least i think so, my numbers are pretty much the same, a1c still the same, and i exercise daily
i feel much better but definitely have to work on my eating habits as my a1c was 8.5 this past testing which is the highest i've ever been
just remember to check your blood sugar (b/s) @ least twice a day, and try and keep it below 200 and your hga1c under 7 &amp; you should be just fine
sorry one last item not everyone agrees but your a1c over a period of 3 months is more important than the bs readings
his a1c was 14.7
tml english hi all, i went to the diabetic clinic today and they told me that my a1c was at 13
i was really feeling proud of myself after my first follow up a1c test results (went down from 6.4 to 5.4 in 3 months)
the post got cut off it should continue to say was &mdash;&mdash;-         fasting less than  100 1 hr after food  less than  120 2 hr after food  less than  140 a1c in low 5s
my a1c is @ 5.4 but my fasting sugars are around 110
i had the a1c done twice because i work for a hospital and they were having health fares and both times it was around 6.5 but they didn't follow up from there and my insurance wasn't active yet so i just had to wait until i could get into see a doctor
tml english i've been reading about different a1c's and people are considering 5 to be too high and 14.1 to be awesome
i am preparing for gastric bypass surgery, i started with an a1c of 11.1 october of 2010
surgeons will not consider you a candidate for procedure unless your a1c is 7.5 or lower, so i started to see a local diabetic specialist at the medical center, in jan
i have my surgical consult tomorrow, so i had an a1c done this afternoon, the nurse asked me what i thought my numbers would be and i figured 7.1
a  n a1c of 14.1 is extremely high and still needs a lot of work, but if that is an improvement from the last check the congrats
i believe that a normal hba1c is less than 6 while the ideal standard for a diabetic is less than 7, which equates to an average daily blood sugar of about 150
a few weeks ago my a1c went from 7.8 to 10
according to new values the medical community now want a1c to be as close as 5 as they can get
a1c is an average of your bgs in a 90 day period which includes all your highs and lows
yet for one of those times she had an a1c of about 7
an a1c of 5 is to low though
just to complicate matters, an a1c of 5 could be awful and a lit worse than 6.5 or so
this is such a good explanation&hellip;my a1c is 6,my dr said he wants me to hold it here, no lower
hey lexadelly~~ i never heard where an a1c reading above 7 is high
all of my dox have told me to get my a1c down when it was a 10
i,'ve only heard of an a1c 7 or below is the best
my last a1c was done just a week ago, and it was at a 8.1
i'm stll paying doctor bills for other things withn my family you can purchase a a1c test kit at walmart for $8.87
hope it keeps up well i am definitely diabetic and at diagnosis, my a1c was 5.7 and the second time i had it checked, it was 5.4 and i have it for sure
om/health/a1c-test/my0
my a1c was 6 and my doctor said that was good, but the article placed his comment into context
14.1 might be considered awesome if the person had an a1c of 20 previously
in reality 14.1 would mean that that person had a lot of hard work ahead trying to get the a1c down toward normal range, but if someone reported an a1c of 14.1 when they had previously had a reading of 20 or more, i would congratulate that person for all the hard work they've done getting the a1c down that far, especially if it was in a short time
my last a1c was 5.5 and i am quite pleased to learn that
i believe i read that 5.8 is normal and anything over is high for a1c, but i am sure anything close to 5.8 is great
most say an a1c (your 3 month average blood glucose percentage)below 7 is considered normal
tml english for a couple of years i have been known pre-diabetic with an a1c of 6.0 to 6.1 last year it went up to 6.4 and i was concerned, but instead of losing weight due to stress factors i gained it
three months ago i went for an a1c and other blood work and was astonished it was at 6.7 and having a new doctor, i wished to try diet and exercise to get it back down to pre-diabetic
however, i was shocked and scared to discover my a1c had jumped to 8
as you may know, i was diagnosed with t2 in august with an a1c of 14
when i was was diagnosed with t2 last april my a1c was 9&hellip;my latest test showed a drop to 5.9&hellip;i have also dropped 30 pounds&hellip;even having diabetes, with my changed diet and drastic increase in excersize i feel better than i have for years
i had a a1c and mine was i think a 10 or so
tml english so, today i was able to look up my results from an a1c test my md did 2 days ago
my a1c is 6.9
i can see her perhaps saying she wants to watch you and not be ready to call it full blown diabetes&hellip;but your a1c is a reflection of your bg over a period of 2-4 mos
but most people settle on three mos&hellip;so if an a1c over a period of three mos of 6.9 does not constitute diabetes to your doctor&hellip;i think she needs to stop treating any diabetic patients&hellip;just one chicks opinion
i find that bizarre in that an a1c of 6.9% translates to an average blood glucose level of 168 mg/dl, well above the 140 where damage is most likely to begin
for at least three months (the a1c test measures your bgl over the last 90 days) you have been in the "danger zone" and your doctor is willing to let you stay in that zone for three more months
even mayo clinic says 2 consecutive a1c above 6.5
i was diagnosed 8 years ago (at the age of 53) with an a1c of 10.0 and was put on metformin and told to cut out sugars and eat low carb &hellip; which i did
in 3 months my a1c was 6.6 and 4 months later 5.8 and for the past 7 1/2 years i have been at or below 6.0 (last a1c was 5.7) pretty good right
if at all possible &hellip;you look for another&hellip;the fact she called an a1c of 6.9 pre-diabetes shows me how little knowledge of the disease she actually has&hellip; i agree
according to the diabetes establishment an a1c of 5.6% and under is normal, 5.7 to 6.4 is considered "pre-diabetic" (diabetic-in-training), 6.5 and higher diabetic  http://www
has your doctor done a1c tests that determines your avg blood glucose over 3 months
))  being a type 1 for 37 years, i had resisted going on a pump until 2011&hellip;now i'm sorry i had waited so long&hellip;it's the best treatment option for me and helped me eliminate scary low bg's and get my a1c's back into the 6's
my latest a1c is 5.8
i wonder if this would be better a1c is 12 but i was recently diagnosised i can't answer that as i have only used insulin, i am a type 1 juvenile, for way more years then i like to think about:)  i was just looking at the drug paula uses and it has alot of issues with it and even stated it should not be used before other methods and when used it is because the condition's needs exceed the risks
we already know what it does to hgb a1c levels and to weight (remember one can of soda per day for a year can result in a weight gain of 15 pounds) but now it&#39;s shown that  it may well impact the lipids that set up our patients for heart disease when they are older
i took myself off metformin and insulin and still good a1c at 5.9 or 6.0
i lost 65 lbs within 5 months, achieved an a1c of 5.5, maintained a general bg (blood glucose) level of 80 to 130 mg/dl, all without the use of diabetes meds
mt last a1c was 7.0 and i'm trying to get it back into the 6's
within about 5 mo i lost 65 lbs and lowered my a1c to 5.5%
i was diagnosed type 2 8 years ago with an a1c of 10.0 and elevated triglycerides
for me, a low-carb (&lt;50 total per day) high fiber diet, losing weight and lots of exercise helped lower my a1c to under 6 and cholesterol ratios are all ideal
i'm a 60+yr old, 20+ year diabetic usually with a1c's in low 7's but jumped to 8.3 for the last year for reasons my dr nor i understand
i have struggled with my a1c for years, however i just got my numbers back from my endo, down to 7.5 from as high as 10.0
right now, my hba1c is 7.1
i have an a1c test done every 3 months
with a hba1c of 5.7 or 6.4 you probly have very little diabetic complecations
i have to admit that recently i haven't been the most diligent and if i really tried i could probably get my a1c down to the low 5's
tml english hi all i went to the doctor and was told that my a1c went down from a 10.5 to 8.2 in three months
don't stop now, just think of all of the benefits that come with reducing your a1c as little as 1 point
for every 1% reduction in a1c, the risk of developing eye, kidney and nerve disease is reduced by 40%
i called the office on april 30 to see if the results came back abd i told them that i was getting worst, they said that my a1c test showed that it was a 13.9 and i also have type a &amp; b flu
but i did get some good news on friday in 2 weeks my a1c test showed that it dropped down to 12.6
im a type 1 and when my a1c was 12, they admitted me into icu as well and were very worried
hi yes i am a diabetic i am type 2 insulin depentant my doctor told me today that if my a1c dont drop down below 10 in 2 more weeks she is going to put me back in for a few more days
i will say this tho&hellip;they will most lilly want to do labs&hellip;at least a1c and a cmp14
my a1c went from 8.8 about 8 months ago when i was first diagnosed to 5.4
i plan to stay at a1c of 5.5 or below for the rest of my life
hoping to get in that a1c area on my next labs (5.8 now) already seen the cholesterol &amp; blood pressure ("ideal" according to my doctor) benefits of low carb
and my a1c has never been below 8.6, which it just now after 11 years has gotten down to
months ago my a1c was 10.5, two weeks ago it was 7.2
the best my a1c has ever been was 9.6
a1c's of 6.4, 6.3, 6.1, 6.0, and 6.0 since pumping down from 7.3 on mdi
my last a1c was 5.7 and my endocrinologist is concerned that i may be having lows i am unaware of
my a1c has been 6.4 for the last two times tested, about 1 month ago and 4 months before that
tml english after 4 months i went from 11.9 a1c to 6.7
so they did my a1c was 10.4 now its 9.6 and if it doesn't go own in a month she is going to put me back on insuln
it took forever to get my a1c down from 13 to 5.9 but i did it by cutting out all white foods, wasn't easy but i did and lost 19 lbs
very true i am very carb sen i have all but cut out pasta rice ,potatoes ,and bread has worked first a1c went from the 8 to the 6 going soon for my next a1c will see how round 2 went  ps i also lost over 30 lbs doing it hi monalisa
my may 2011 a1c was 5.5
i haven't had an a1c that low since before my dx in 1995
i have to come back in and have an a1c hemoglobin and a glucose testing done every 4-6 months
82 isn't really that low, if it was an estimate based on your a1c then that would be roughly an a1c of 4.5% which taking lab accuracy error into account would be at the bottom end of normal
that a1c is perfect and many people would be lucky to have that a1c number
my a1c1 was staying hi
i need to be in full control&hellip;so i am sure i will do it&hellip;i am having my first a1c test on january 16th
back in the early 2000's, my a1c kept creeping up and my pcp (who was treating my diabetes at the time) prescribed avandia (even though i was a type 1 and on insulin)
some days my bg goes crazy just because&hellip;  my a1c  last month was 5.4 so i must be doing something right
my a1c went from 13 to 7
my a1c has been 5.2 for the last 2 months which means i must be doing something right
i too can always guess what a1c will be, i have my a1c once a year, had it twice the first year, was such a good number that i do it less often now, because i stick to diet and exercise and testing
when diagnosed my a1c was 14.1 and fasting blood sugar was 366
jojo hi everyone,   i just got a call from my doctor&hellip;my a1c was 5.9 down from 9.3 at diagnosis
i should have the a1c tests back next week&hellip;if its lower than 6.3 i can realize my dream of becoming a mother
although at first glance a 5.7 a1c is good, if you are dropping low frequently and bounce high frequently then it's actually worse than having a higher a1c
my last a1c was also 5.7&hellip;i can spike high whenever i eat though,even after a yogurt it can bounce to 160,other things even higher
high morning sugar help any suggestion by hba1c is 6.9
tml english my doc left me a message today saying i was prediabetic and that all i had to do was diet/exercise and repeat a1c in 6 months&hellip; im terrified
bun/creatinine ratio   17 sodium, serum         139    mmol/l potassium, serum      4.6    mmol/l chloride, serum       99       mmol/l carbon dioxide, total    25  mmol/l calcium, serum         9.6  mg/dl protein, total, serum      7.3   g/dl albumin, serum         4.2 bilirubin, total      0.2  mg/dl globulin, total     3.1  g/dl a/g  ratio  1.4 bilirubin, total       0.2  mg/dl alkaline phosphatase, s      93  iu/l ast (sgot)            40  iu/l alt  (sgpt)            47 h   iu/l hemoglobin a1c        8.8 h   tsh   what is this
my a1c did come down to 7.3 though and the nurse practitioner was pleased
tml english hi to all my dc friends just wanna share some great news tested my a1c today and doc said its 6.9( say what just in january was 11.9) i almost fell off the chair good job
when i was diagnosed i had an a1c at 14 and i am now an 8.5
cde, as noted in the summer 2010 issue of "diabetic living" for the side bar article called "abc's of control":   a1c (blood glucose) should be less than 7% and with blood glucose levels fasting/before meals 70-130 mg/dl and 1-2 hours after the start of a meal  40 mg/dl and &gt; 50 mg/dl
my short term goal is to get my hba1c to 5.6 or less (5.9 at last check) and long term to 5.0 or less
i was surprised to hear that my a1c was 7.8
two weeks ago i had an a1c with results of 6.5
:o)   tony5657 in new braunfels, tx a year ago i was pre-diagnosed, bs 250 and a1c 9.5, with this condition and was told to exercise and diet
my last visit i was told it was excelent keeping bs between 100 and 110 and my a1c was 5.4, but the testing was done to keep a check on my sugar
a1c of 6.5 says you are a the lowest end of the scale of what defines diabetes
a1c of 7 or below is recommended for diabetics so there is no need at this point to worry about damage being done to your body
if the reading is more than 180, you need to get on meds;  if it's less than 180, your a1c will stay below 7 which is fine
hi yes your doctor was wrong (sorry); an a1c of 6.5 defines diabetes
my last a1c was 6.5
my a1c was 11 when first diagnosed 5 years ago, now it's 5.2 (up from 4.9, but stable)
so take a few deep breaths&hellip;   your a1c of 6.5 is not terrible - many of us started out much higher - mine was 10
if you are not taking meds (and it sounds like you are not), then i would be willing to bet if you cut back on carbs (in the form of bread, potatoes, pasta, and refined sugar) and focus on lean proteins, a few servings of fresh fruit a day, some lowfat dairy and lots of veggies, and if you modify your life to include at least 30 minutes of cardio activity a day, you will most likely be able to get your a1c down to 5 or below without further intervention
thanks for the info&hellip;&lt;3 no thats not a bab a1c it's a good one  best wishes harlen i believe the "new" ideal for an a1c is under 7.0 according to the american diabetes association
regarding your a1c of reading of 6.6, it kinda depends on where you had been, and where you want to be
what had your a1c been when you were 1st dx'd
in my case, 6.6 would be horrible because my last a1c had been 6.2, and i would be going the wrong way
a1c a truly normal a1c is between 4.6% and 5.4%   a1cs are not as good a measure of actual blood sugar control in individuals as they are for groups
an a1c of 5.1% maps to an average blood sugar of 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) or less when group statistics are analyzed, but normal variations in how our red blood cells work make the a1cs of truly normal individuals fall into a wider range
note: if you are anemic your a1c will read much lower than your actual blood sugars and the resulting a1c is not a useful gauge of your actual blood sugar control
hp    heart attack risk rises in a straight line fashion as a1c rises from 4.6%
my blood sugars run between 120 and 60 but my a1c is 7.4
ada says a good a1c is below 7%, before meals from 70-130mg/dl, and 1-2 hours after eating should be less than 180 mg/dl
whereas the aace recommends and a1c below 6.5%, before meals from 80-110 mg/dl, and 2 hours after eating should be 80-140 mg
i also find it interesting that a1c is discussed as to where the numbers should be and then put out that a1c isn't an accurate measurement for individuals
what is a1c by the way a1c or glycosolated hemoglobin is a blood test that is done by your doctor to get an idea of what your blood glucose has been doing over the previous 2-3 months
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
my a1c has been under 6 for more than 2 years
my intitial a1c was 8.4
and make sure i get my a1c's tested every 3 months
was he talking about your a1c being 10.9
your a1c is the test you speak of, and it is the averaging of how much glucose is staying in your blood stream during a 3-6 month period
my doctor took me off of this med because of the risks, now my blood sugars and a1c have increased, i take metformin 1000mg 2x day, any suggestion of a med that could be used to replace the advandia
bg was 115 and my a1c was a 6
my last a1c at the doctors a couple of weeks ago was a 6.1 and he wasn't happy cause up to now they have been under 5.9
:)   good luck &amp; hugs to lower my triglycerides i lower my carbs to  about 40 a day it worked for me :) the hba1c test stands for glycohemoglobin and it gives you an average of your blood glucose levels over the past 3 months (like jim said
when i pick up a copy of my blood work, it lists the expected following values for the hba1c results: 4.1 to 6.4  non-diabetic children ages 1.5 to 18 yrs 4.3 to 6.0% non-diabetic adults 6.2 to 7.0% diabetic well controlled 7.0 to 8.0% diabetic fair control &gt; 8.0% diabetic poor control   (i don't know what happened to 6.1% in the above charts
i have no idea what they mean, but you a1c score is a 3 month snap shot of your blood sugar levels
it's done the job as my last a1c was 5.2
by the way, my a1c was 5.6 (surprisingly
i tend to agree with kdroberts about things affecting a1c levels, i have no idea why but this time is was 5.6 down from 5.7 with self testing numbers in diabetic range for sure
an a1c>6.5% can be used as a diagnostic test for type 2 diabetes mellitus and better yet an oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt) is the gold standard diagnostic test
i am working on lowering my a1c, last was 6.2
i am hesitant to tell my doctor though until i have managed to bring my a1c to about 5.5 i so totally agree with you
i told you i got my a1c to 5.6 after 1 1/2 years
they swicth me to meteformin er and they said my a1c1 was 8.2 so now i just have to adjust to this again
i used one before i had a doctor and when i had my a1c from the lab it was only a 0.4 difference
amazon a1cnow self check it's 59.95 comes with two test strips extra box of test strips are 18.50 if you but both at same time 78.45 there are other testers on amazon some a little cheaper not by much and some higher about highest i looked at was 160.00 based on reviews the a1cnow is the way to go &hellip; but the price is a deal breaker for me
maybe dr write a scrip for it just a thought they discussed this awhile back on here i went online to amazon and bought the kit it's like a bg meter but for a1c and i took it at day of my dr appt and she did one in her office it's was .02 difference in her test and store bought so far it seams pretty accurate i get my a-c tested again in a month and will compare again then but they get you close so i use it as a guide i average my bg tests and compare the calculates a1c against it again really close and will compare to next lab a1c but so far glad i bought it wow 0.02 is pretty good i was honestly expecting like 0.1 or worse   thanks for the reply :)
my endo requests an hba1c blood test every 3 months
the hba1c gives him a reading of my average blood glucose over the past 2 to 3 months, making it impossible for us to fool our doctors or ourselves that we might be in better control
for example, my last a1c was 6.9 which means my bg averaged about 150 mg/dl (or 8.3mmol) over the past 3 months
your a1c gives you an average of what your glucose levels are over approximately 3 months
to find out what your current a1c is and also ask him what he would like your a1c to be
your a1c is important because it gives you a true picture of how well you are controlling your levels over a period of time, not just for 1 day
cat:  ask your doctor what your a1c levels were while hospitalized and how often he/she wants you to be checked for a1c
my a1c has been less than 5.9
still in control of my bs, no change in my a1c either, still 5.7
my a1c is 7%, so my diabetes is not that out of control that i should be having these severe symptoms
tml english i was just diagnosed in september with type 1 my a1c was 14 and i just went back to the doctor yesterday and it was 7.5
my last several a1c's are 5.5 to 5.8
good news my a1c went down to 6.5, from 7.5  and i lost 15lbs
blood work was back and my fasting level was 97; triglycerides down 50 pts and a1c 5.2
great job like those numbers my last a1c was 5.2 also weight was down cholesterol numbers were good
my doctor has an a1c done every 3 months
they took blood to test my a1c and 2 other things (don't remember what)
my a1c was down to 6.2 (yippee) but everything else so normal
a1c is 5.7 but he tells me i'm not doing it right
i still put in 8-hour days on my feet, exercise regularly in the form of farm work, take care of my feet as the army taught me to and do whatever i have to to keep that a1c down below 6.5
as for my diabetes i was at a 12.8 a1c when diagnosed then down to 5.4 a1c when i went in for my follow up
i received a lot of help and support when i first came on in march, support that helped me get my d under control and drop from a 10.9 to a 5.7 a1c in 6 months
my son that's 4 was diagnosed with type 1b about 3 months ago he was put on insulin at first but taking off shortly because he kept running too low when we started out he had a yeast infection and an infection in his finger because he sucks on his fingers he is also epileptic and takes keppra for that when we went into the doctor for the infection i told him that he was peeing a lot and he always wanted something to drink it was the start of summer vacation so i thought it was just because he was outside all the time and its hot and i remember that he was also getting more sweets and drinking milk and eating a lot more ice cream he really didn't do too much dairy before this summer so the doctor check for ketones and he had ketone he then checked his sugar it was at 230 they sent us to the hospital to get blood work then right back to the doctors office they put him on insulin and said that his a1c was 11 we done that for a few days we went back to see the doctor and we decided that we wanted to go to cincinnati children's there's a recheck is a 1 c it was still 11 we were there for 4 days learning how to do everything got more blood work done went back about a week and a half two weeks later his a1c was down 8.6 and they noticed that his sugar was still going low after taking him off his long lasting and putting him way down on his after meal so they ended up taking him completely off he has been off of insulin for about 2 months now his blood sugars run great his morning fasting is anywhere from 65 to 85 thes after meals are always back to normal by 3 hours he just went back to the doctor just last week and his a1c was down to 6.7 and they done a peptide and the doctor said he was normal his fasting was 81 his c peptide was 0.4 and his insulin was 1.1 i'm not really sure how that's read but she said  please somebody help me understand this stuff does sound strange
a1c was bad, 10.3; bg was 191
its not out of control ( a1c was 6.2) but dr haf brought yo gadtric bypass
results are everything is good numbers but my a1c was up a little at 6.2 never been that high most of the others were 5.6,5.5,5.4,5.4 and 5.3 may have to try a little harder next time alan hey alan, if i didn't enjoy looking @ that gorgeous little girl of yours, i'd permanently kick you off this site for having a1c#s that i can only dream about
a1c - february 2012 blood pressure - daily lipid panel - november 2011, next one scheduled for april eye exam - may 2011, next one scheduled for may microalbumin - november 2011, next one scheduled for april well documented
because they are not finding anything neurological they "the dr's" think it is due to my high a1c levels which happen to be double than what they are supposed to be, (normal a1c 5.0-7.0 mine 12.1) this has to do with my diabetes
before the first surgery i was a pre-diabetic on no meds a1c 5.0
my endo has told me that just because my a1c are done from 7.1 to 5.7
my a1c's have been running ~ 6.3 so my med team is happy
i keep an a1c of around 6
( feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
you'll find what works for you, just ease into it, you'll be a pro before you know it:) for the record, my a1c is 7 so i feel it was worth it
blood sugar went from 63 to 701&mdash;-i was given insulin&mdash;-responded beautifully to it, the rest is kind of a long story&mdash;-and private information, so, please write me back&mdash;&mdash;in some cases of type 1, we don't need that much insulin&hellip;i am just so dogged tired of feeling like i don't belong into any category&mdash;&mdash;i am still looking for a new endo, as the excellent one i had&mdash;-his nurse&mdash;-she hated me, so, please write me back&mdash;-i have had insulin again about 4-5 times&hellip;it always works, but, there are so many limitations i have as far as money&mdash;-i work 2 jobs, i now get enough to eat everyday&mdash;-i see keytones after eating&hellip;my a1c took a long time to get up again, as i almost died from the metformin, not the insulin&mdash;&mdash;-anne thanks, i have been taking the metformin and i have not rejected it my concerns are (1) i have for the last 3 months testied in the normal range between 85 and 125 the highest
my a1c is 6.0 hi&hellip;this is anne&hellip;hope you had a wonderful thanksgiving
my last a1c was 6.2 and now i wake up lower in the morning
kind of a bummer as i have labs scheduled for tomorrow morning &hellip; hoping this will have minimal effect on my a1c as i really busted my hump this past 3 months keeping my bgl in line
my a1c is 5.6
just as i was diagnosed with an a1c of 14 i could barely step up on a curb with my good leg
a1c is the blood test they do that shows your average glucose level over 60-90 days
i just found out that my a1c is 11.4 :-( friend me
as a result, my numbers have come down (my original a1c was 14 - i am having my blood work done tomorrow for my first follow up a1c), i am happier, healthier, and i've lost almost 22lbs
i went friday and my numbers were not great to say the least (a1c of 11.5) i have had it down to as low as 7 before)
my 3 month blood work showed my a1c went from 8.8 to 5.7 and my fasting sugar from 224 to 124
bear in mind that a1c is the average 90 day sugar level&hellip;and your red blood cells die every 90 days, so depending on where they are in that cycle, (and how many of them are at which point) you should see a good immediate drop after 3 months but not if your sugars stay up that high
i just did my first blood test, and my a1c was 5.2, and my protein levels, b12, and iron are better than it has ever been
i developed a meal plan on which i discontinued my twice daily insulin injection, maintained my bg (blood glucose) at 80 to 130 mg/dl, achieved an a1c of 5.5% and lost 65 lbs over the course of 5 mo
well&hellip;  it has been over a year and my a1c has dropped from 7.4 to 6.5
calayx hi - i'm surprised that you doctor prescribed metformin when your a1c is 6.5
my a1c has been 6.6 for years
9 years ago i was diagnosed with t2 with a a1c of 6.2 - no medication, it's been 6.6 for the last 3 yrs
with that being said in your comment, i have to wonder how my a1c got up to 6.5
his a1c  has decrease from  8.1 to 6.7 in 6 months
tml english a1c came back 6.3
my a1c was 7.4 and my fasting glucose was 167
my a1c reading has hit an all time high of 12
:) i just want everyone to know that i went to my endocrinologist yesterday and my a1c last time was 12.7 and now it's down to 10.3
okay, you beat my a1c of 9.9
i too was at an a1c of 12 and now i'm down to 7.2 after loosing 17lbs and change of diet and exercise program
my a1c was 8.0 hi chelci, accetance sometimes comes and goes especially at your age
at diagnosis my a1c was 7.3
a1c below 6 each time
other than a two a1c readings in the low 7's about 4 years ago, my a1c's have ranged from 5.9 to the current 6.8, indicating good control
i'm in my fortys have had type two for a couple yrs my bg was all over the place and had allot of complications with it not being managed  my endo finally out me on the pump and about a month later with proper eating habits from dietician all my problems cleared up i get my insulin only med i am currently on all day and blouses at meals to cover carbs my a1c went from around 12 to now 6.1 as of yesterday's lab and i have no issues any more and i'm back to doing the things i did before diagnosis i feel great labs are good if not better than before my attitude is much better and my outlook on life has improved allot my brother in law i just recently found out has type 1 for twenty yrs and at first was rough he says then he went on pump and started eating right and has been problem free for 12 yrs he has helped me allot along the way and people here have helped allot to hope this help you hang in there it is rough but can get better it's hard to make lifestyle changes when you've been one way for forty yrs trust me it wasn't an easy road to get were i'm at now thanks so much for your response
my a1cs have all been very good, except i have not had one done in almost a year now, i had 3 so far, 2 6 months apart after diagnosis, and then one other
i began having some readings from 200-470 so i went to my doctor and they run a a1c at  7.8
hba1c  for very tight between 5-6%
i deal with my type 2 but my bg is too high, i think&hellip;140's to 250's, but dr says a1c at 7.2, up from 6.4, is ok
a study, funded by the national institutes of health, that found a "statistically significant reduction" in a1c levels in people with type 2 diabetes after 15 months after routine periodontal treatment, taylor said
he helps me a lot and my blood pressure is normal now and a1c is down and clresterol is down and ifeel great my eyes are better to i know its hard i had days i felt like i was just going to give up but i was determend to go on i have pets that keep me motivated and a husband with dementia so i have to keep going you will be surprised find somteing that means  a great  deal to you  and focus you cannot do it oveernight but you will do it good luck to everyone i have been on metformin for 6 years but my dr still has me as pre diabetic
learn new things all the time ,i am currently doing the paleo diet which is working for me,will know next blood work but now a1c is 6.6  &hellip;you have to try different things and find out what works
my a1c dropped to 5.7
my a1c 6.5
my a1c is also 6.5 and bs range between 123 and 187
although your a1c is good, it is an average of your bg over the past 2 or 3 months and doesn't rule out highs (that are then balanced out by lower bg's)
steve my morning bg is generally 86-95 and i have my a1c down to 5.7  i have worked very hard with my doctor and a nutritionist,  i was diagnosed last october, and went on a life changing diet and bought a treadmill
my endo expects to see me every 3 months regardless of lab results; an a1c every 3-thats my motto
i would be concerned of the a1c dropping so drasticly in just 3 months do not be suprised if your a1c is higher next time they take it
you&#39;re doing great and stay optimistic, your next a1c could be in the 7&#39;s
if my a1c was 4.1 then i would test my bg no less than once every two hours to prevent a severe low
i subscribe wholeheartedly to the low-carb approach and have found that for my 5'3" small frame, i am able to maintain a body weight of 120 lbs and my a1c levels in the 6's by limiting my carbs to 120 grams per day
and their hemoglobin a1c levels remained lower for a year after treatment, the study team reports in diabetes care, online july 22
the participants' average a1c levels fell from 9.3 to 8.4 during the experiment
among the eight teens who were tested one year after the study, the average a1c level was 8.4, suggesting that the health benefits were sustained in the long term
tml english hi everyone, just letting all know that i went to the doctor and my a1c went down from 10 to 8
i've been diabetic type 2 for about 7 yrs now and my a1c's have never been above 7.5 and have been stable at 6.2 for well over a year now
a1c is 7.9, it is creeping down slowly, what r some things that work well for others
my last a1c was 6.8 and i expect the next one to be better
my a1c was down a bit (still working on getting it down more), i had lost 10 lbs
even an accomplishment of an a1c of 6.9 is something to cheer about
last a1c was 7.1  having a hard time dealing with it because i have never noticed any symptoms and never gone low so i do wellfor awhile then just eat so thought about other methods check luckyvitamins
my last a1c was good at 6.5 but for some reason my triglycerides jumped to 437 from 213 9 mos ago
i've lost 20 lbs and my a1c was 5.9
my a1c ;has gone from 11.5 to 9.3 after only 2 weeks of glucocil
cutting back on the carbs has enabled me to maintain my weight at a reasonable 120 pounds and has enabled me to keep my a1c's at 7 or below
hello rhe a1c shows that your meeter is good and right on with its reeding i just have a one tuch and it will show me what my a1c shoud be ,so when i get my a1c and if it is off then i know my meeter may be off
best wishes harlen a1c tells a story of your last 3 months of blood glucose
so a1c is a mean and it goes back 3 months
i'm not perfect, i've hit a plateau &amp; haven't lost any since so i need to figure the next step but my a1c is down from 9.4 to 4.3  so i'm thrilled
if your a1c is around 7, you should be healthy enough to get pregnant
my a1c was 5.9
you might want to start testing after meals, especially if your a1c is not in the low to mid 5's
yes my a1c is usually about 7.4 which is only .4 above my target
yes my a1c is usually about 7.4 which is only .4 above my target
which i believe is why my last a1c was up 20 points
so far that seems to be working out okay in 2013 i lost 75 pounds and lowered my a1c to under 6.0 (oh, and survived a stroke too boot) great job
i have maintained my bg readings in the range of 80 to 130 mg/dl (4 to 7 mmol/l) and achieved an a1c of 5.5% for a while
i am sitting waiting to see my doctor as i type this message because my last a1c showed 9.5
my sister gets to eats lots more carbs than myself, being a marathon runner and a size 2&hellip; but my a1c is just as good, my last one was .1 better than hers
to answer the question in your title, yes i believe you would still have diabetes (type 2)   i have been on a ketogenic meal plan and lost weight on it (65 lbs over 5 mo), and  was able to keep my a1c in the mid 5s, my blood glucose below 130 mg/dl   (meal plan avaiilable upon request)   however, there may be some other side effects from ketogenic meal plans:  this article speaks of ketogenic meal plans as a treatment for epilepsy, but i believe it is applicable when used for other reasons like for diabetes
god's best to you and yours   james baker if your a1c was in 5s and is not now, should it mean that you have insulin resistance, not diabetes
that has required the alteration of my meal plan and has raised my a1c into the 6s
i went to the diabetic clinic and i was told that my a1c was only down a little from 9.5 to 9.1
wow, i thought i was bad with an a1c of 6
i've got a descent a1c at 6.9 but my bs#s were over 300 most days and since nov
sorry ben there  i had to get to know what my insulin to carb ratio was ,keeping a log and all that lol but now i know what my ratio is and my a1c 6.0 to 7.0 the better i keep on top of it the better the a1c is best wishes harlen thanks harlan i have begun keeping a log
i am lucky to be able to say i am in pretty good control based on my a1c (last one 6.0) and my daily readings
its not always from what ya eat for some people your blood will make triglycerides my blood is so thick they got to boil my blood to get a accrect a1c panel i eat no more then 5 grams of fat each meal
thats not to bad when they tested my blood befor they knew i had diabetis was to hight for the meeter to read lol and the a1c was greates then 12
also, on april 3 she has to have some blood tests done for her thyroid condition and i asked them to add an a1c to the tests since they were going to be drawing anyway, they agreed and put it on the orders but said the finger stick ones they do are good enough, her first one was a 5.0 on feb 6th and the one on march 20 was 5.9, which concerned them along with higher bgl readings although she is on medication
i should also mention this finger stick a1c gives them results in only 6 minutes
does the finger stick a1c test every 3 months
i have only been able to see the part where the get the blood in this extremely skinny glass tube and then from there i can't see what they do with it, but i did ask them on feb 6 what it was and she said an a1c test and when i asked how long before they had results she told me 6 minutes
most insurance companies limit an a1c to one every 90 days so if you have the one from the office done and the one from the lab done they may deny one of them
i have had three of the finger a1c test 7.5   5.7  5.1 they all work good for me do you still get the blood draw type a1c done
and that one was a 12.5 a1c the rest where all finger test ,but next a1c i get i w will ask for the blood draw one, but to me blood is blood no matter where they take it from thanks
however my a1c is at 11.6 and my dr is fine with this but i have issuses with it that high and i am loosing weight to the point i now am on hospice so i guess the nexet 6 months will tell
bob i agree with you that you should be concerned with a1c at 11.6
they worked when i was at 550 &amp; a1c was 10.3 &mdash;   i don't want to go too low
i've cut my meds in half my numbers are better all the way around my a1c is still getting better it's at 5.7   i know it's not recommended not to listen to doctors but i think i care more about me than he does   diane what frustrates me most is the fact that it never ends
i also keep my blood glucose in the normal range, or close to it, and my last a1c was 5.5 last may all without the use of medication
(i've never had an a1c this low since i was dx'd in 1995)   i know everyone can't get these results exactly, but you can lose the weight and inches by eating low carbohydrate meal plans
my last a1c was 6.6
i achieved an a1c of 5.5, have been able to maintain "normal" bg (blood glucose) levels (80 to 130 mg/dl) all while discontinuing my twice daily injected  insulin (nph)
i just found out i have diabetes and my a1c is 8.1, i have started a diet, but i'd lie if i say i know everything i need to do
my last a1c was 6.8
my last a1c on the 18th was at 5.9 but i had had a lot of lows to
a1c was 5.5, and i lost 65 lbs of weight within the first 5 mo
i am a type 2 and i have maintained a1c between 5.0 and 5.6 for that same period
i am very controlled (a1c of 5.5) so hopefully my advice will help
most home-monitoring systems used by diabetics measure eag in one type of unit, while a1c, which doctors have used for more than 25 years as the major measure of glucose control, is in different units
last reviewed: 06/07/2008 | last updated: 06/07/2008 one of the interesting things about the eag versus a1c versus whatever is that it was brought about by new a1c monitoring technology that pushes the "normal" levels 1 to 1.5 percent lower
(iirc an a1c of 6.0 is equivalent to an eag of around 140, which is waytoohigh, and the highest "normal" a1c reading &mdash; equivalent to eag of around 100 &mdash; would be approximately 4.5%)   i'd just as soon know the real reading (a1c)&hellip; or, both
i have 3 goals 1- a1c of 5.6 , 2- come out of insulin and loose 38 pounds (i have lost 12 since 6/26) - so for me the food part is the most difficult
my hba1c on oct 7 was 11.3 and a month after, 10.3
tml english just recently my a1c was 13.5 i need help in my diet what helps to bring my sugar down by diet
my a1c in december was 12.6 i was depressed and couldnt find a doc/team that i got along with until i found my new doc/team in dec
just had a new a1c done at end of feb and it came out at 7.2 whole lot better
the one that worked the best and got my a1c down to 6.5 was the "plate" diet
on the plate diet i was able to keep my a1c around 6.5-7.0 and my daily bg's never went out of the 85-120 range
my last a1cs have been in the 9s and 10s
648-a1cs-blood-testing-and-type-1-diabetes
tml english despite having diabetes for over 14 years now, i've never had an a1c below a 7
i've never had one over an 8 (that i know of), but i've learned (sadly, only within the last couple of years) that an a1c below a 7 or 6 is desired
my may 2011 a1c was 5.5, and i have lost about 50 lbs
this is what helped me lower my a1c from 14.1 to 5.9 in less than 4 months
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
your a1c is a accumlation of your numbers over about a three month period so if your high your a1c will also be high
tml english hi friends,   i checked my a1c yesterday and it was 8.4 and i am very upset with my readings and i am planning to get a insulin pump if it suits me
i went to the doctor last week and my a1c was a 10.1 and i was feeling fine but my doctor put me on another med and said if it does not bring my blood sugar down i will have to take insulin but before then i started to make a change in my life by not drinking sodas and that include the diet ones
my a1c was 230
have tried soooo hard to eat right,test enough times a day,take my insulin as perscribed but yet since my numbers aren't in the low 70's and my a1c is only 7
since i have started the "experiment" 3 + yrs ago, i was able to get off my twice daily injections of nph (i know not possible for t 1s but you could likely reduce the amount taken), and lost 65 lbs over the course of 5 mo all the while maintaining my bg (blood glucose) levels at 80 to 130 mg/dl and achieved an a1c of 5.5%
they drew blood and the next day my doctor called and told me my a1c was high (9.1) but my sugar was 37
my doc has not put me on any meds for my pre diabetes, wonder why if my bg is this high and my a1c was 129
i have lost 15 pds and my sugars are stable and my a1c is down to 5.4
i hate having to measure or count :( so that's why i cut everything i loved out&hellip;and at my last 3 month blood work my a1c is 6.3
my a1c was 7.2 and that is acceptable but i am working like you to get my numbers down
my a1c moved from 12 to 9.8 in the first month, and it is almost the 3 month mark now, and i'm sure it will be much lower now as my daily bg numbers range from 70-140
my a1c was 6.5 it went up to 6.9 because i got sick for a few months and now i am getting it down even lower
i also had maintained a bg (blood glucose) level in the 80 to 130 mg/dl range and achieved an a1c of 5.5
my a1c was 8.9 and my blood sugar was 189
i'm on metformin once daily, now my bg runs less than 100 and my a1c is  4.1
15386-my-a1c-s-1980-2011
tml english my a1c's 1980-2011   i thought it might be interesting to some of you to see my a1c's starting in 1980
a1c testing was not available until 1976
my doc started a1c's with his patients in 1980
i've had it for 21 years and had my lowest a1c of 6.5 last month
brittany, if you can lower your a1c's to less than 6.5, and eventually to 6.0, you will be in great shape
i feel like if i have an a1c of 7 i will die of horrible complications, it's good to know that yes it needs to be in the 6's but that having an a1c in the 7s isnt going to put me in kidney failure tomorrow&hellip; i'm 27 and have been diabetic since i was 11
andrea, i worked several years to reduce my a1c to the 5's
my a1c went down to 7.2 from 8.4 i have trying very hard
still, my bg is all over the place, yet a1c is down to 6.6
hello and welcome see what you doc has to say but with an a1c of 8.0 you may need more then just diet  you may not need then if you can cut the carbs way back  each of us are different  best wishes h
i had gone to the doctor and she didn't like my a1c (it was at 7.4) so switched my meds and didn't like the cholestrol (107) so raised the dosage of lipitor
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
"   well i looked to find an a1c to blood glucose (bg) chart and i found an application which will tell you what the average bg level will be with a particular a1c
using that converter an a1c of 10.5 would be average plasma blood glucose = 297 mg/dl (or 16.5 mmol/l if you are outside of the usa) and his average whole blood glucose = 265 mg/dl (or 14.7 mmol/l )   before you leave that page scroll down to the "a1c to blood glucose chart" toward the bottom of the page
i've been eating like this for 3 yrs, managed my bg without the use of diabetes meds had a 5.5 a1c, and lost 65 lbs in 5 mo
my last a1c was 6.1
my a1c now after being on the pump is now down to 5.6
a1c decreased 1.6 which really made my day
hoping my hga1c drops some although technically it is good at 5.4 i'm curious how you are doing with the bydureon
my a1c went up .4 and no weight loss so the dr gave me a choice of staying with it or switching back
i thought 6.0 was the norm for a1c readings and ur at .4
murmouse said the a1c went up .4, so the total a1c was 6.4
i don't go back to endo until july for recheck, but my a1c started at 5.4
i did the walk &amp; watching carbs &amp; got down to a great a1c  5.7 with medication &amp; walking, but since this surgery i'm taking my sugars &amp; since i'm 110 and 90's  i'm not taking any meds, plus i'm not walking right now  so i thought maybe this undiagnosed pain thing my be my problem
what blows my mind is i never asked the clinics to treat my diabetes&mdash;-they rudely walked in , glanced at my chart, said " oh&mdash;-you have an a1c of 5.9&mdash;-you are not diabetic&mdash;&mdash;they did not even bother checking the fact that i was almost admitted for kedoacidosis three times in the last 4 years at the hospital&mdash;&mdash;i told them that, being they were that interested in erasing my diabetic diagnosis
because i have learned so much more about this disease and how it effects "me" that my a1c has gone from 8.9 to 6.7 in just 10 months
my a1c has dropped from 8.2 to 7.2 i feel so much better because i have more control than i did on the novo log and lantus and i do not have to carry nano needles on and run to the bathroom to give my shot before every meal
i found out that my a1c was 12.5 on xmas actually i have that information right in front of me; an a1c of of 12.5 would translate into an average blood sugar reading of 315
you are t1, you have diabetes, all i'm saying here is that an a1c of 12.5 probably means your normal score is lower than the 900 it was that day&hellip;maybe more typically a 500-650 range
to speed the healing you really need to have really tight control, a1c under 6, blood sugars under 120 at all time kind of deal
tml english just got the bad news today my 3 month a1c test was at 13.5 up from 12.9 my endo is throwing a fit about it
tml english on friday my primary care physician drew blood and checked my a1c it was 6.1 on monday another place checked my a1c and said it was 6.3 how can it go up that much in three days
a1c is an average of every 3 months
keeping your a1c in the mid "6s" is the best
they do sell a a1c test at walmart for 9.99 i believe
my a1c runs between 5-6
i went from a1c of 10.4 to a 6.7 (last week of jan) i am only on 1000 mg twice a day of metformin
my a1c is still 7.4 and i range from 130's or more in am to over 200 pm
i've had a1c's around 5 for the past 2 years and seeing an endo was the best thing i ever did
(this is up from 11) your hemoglobin a1c was much improved at 5.9
my last a1c was around 8
thank you and may god bless you too, mary well like you said i dont like to brag but my last 4 a1c has been 5.4,5.4,and5.4 the last one was 5.5 my next one is in oct
i am very happy to say that since my last visit in august with my endo i have further brought my a1c to 7.5% and managed to get my hdl and ldl all within normal limits
a1c tests at some of their stores today and tomorrow from 10 am to 6 pm
which if that was an average for me that would have put my a1c at over 12
an a1c drop of 4 points in 5 weeks is darn good
my a1c went from 10 1/2 down to 7.5, which is a lot more manageable and i'm feeling better
my apt with the dr was a few weeks ago my a1c was very high at 9.8
i told my doctor that my goal is an  a1c of around 7
so he went along with my a1c of 7 even though he didn't agree with me
now the new research says that those 70 or 75 forgot which,  should shoot for an a1c of 8
:) i have had the omnipod since 2005 and it brought my a1c from a 13 to a 7.4
it has made my life with diabetes so much easier and has significantly lowered my a1c&hellip;11.3 to 7.5 in 3 months
i thought i was very controlled on my injections (a1c of 6.8 for most of the time) but my a1c's have been in the lower 6's since the pump
i lost 65 lbs over 5 mo, kept my bg level at 80 to 130 mg/dl, achieved an a1c of 5.5
my a1c 7.8 my levels are from 145 to 235 what is a guy too do about it
i have kept my bg (blopd glucose) levels in the 80 to 130 mg/dl range without diabetes meds, achieved an a1c of 5.5% for a time
james last fall my a1c was 9.1  i just gad my test and it was 5.8  i'm taking metforim and making myself diet strictly
tml english i am very lost i was diagnosed with diabetes about 3 months ago a1c is 6.5 daily fasting blood sugar is about 119
i have a high protein, low carb meal plan by which i have managed my t2 diabetes without the use of any diabetes medicaion and achieved an a1c of 5.5% and had been keeping my bg (blood glucose) levels in the vicinity of 80 to 130 mg/dl
my first a1c test at the end of april was 5.07 and my doctor
my first a1c was over 13
my last a1c was 6.6
my hba1c was extremely high for at least 3 years and speaking form my families persective i was like a completely different person
how come then that so many diabetics don't have their a1c under 7%
some say an a1c below 7 is a good goal and will cut the odds of complications substantially
most professionals that i have talked with seem to feel that in many situations, it would be highly unlikely for a pwd to get the proper nutrition and achieve an a1c equivalent of a person without diabetes or even below 6.0
my doctor has always stated to me that she would like to see my a1c get down to 6 for starters, but would love to see it as low as 5
the reason i wasn't happy with was because 5 yrs ago i was tested due to having polycyctic ovarian syndrome and even with fastings in upper 70-low 80 and a1c of 5.4, i failed the glucose tolerance test twice
by the way, my a1c now fluctuates between 5.7 and 6.2, when i started 3 years ago it was 11.4
a person with a very desirable low a1c of, lets say, 5.6 is doing the happy dance
an a1c below 6.0 would be normal range
when you consider some may be at a1c of 12 or higher, then being at 7 or 8 is really good, is it the best, no but it isn't the higher number
also, do you think it is reasonably possible to get all the necessary nutrition, if a pwd aims for an a1c of less than 6.0
my a1c has been a consistent 6.0&mdash;-6.2 ever since i was diagnosed 18 yearas ago
my a1c has never been below 6
seriously, an a1c of 6.0-6.2 is awsome for a diabetic and many never get close to that
tml english i just read article on type 2 it said type 2's didnt need to test because of  the cost oftesting it said a better guide was to have a1c test every 2-3 months
i pray you get to feeling much better soon   james my last a1c was 5.3, so i think i am ok on the diet angle
my aunt lost her vision several yrs ago due to diabetes and has been on my butt ever since finding out a1c came back at 9.3 last yr

tml english well i had dr appointment at the begin of this month and found out that my a1c is 7.3 and he didn't put me on the med yet &hellip; well i try to control on my diet but seem like my blood glucose still high and i would like to try to get pregnant soon that why i wantto be on med &hellip;also after i eat i got headache or not feeling good but it will go away
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
om/ i was able to lower my a1c from 10.7 to 5.7 using magnesium(slo-mag) chromium picolinate,b-12, benfotiamine, turmeric, and cinnamon&hellip; they all come in pill form at a health food store or on-line
get an a1c test also (3 months average)
a1c is a 6.2 and fasting bg was 139 in nov but was lower in dec
tml english diag in june this year a1c 10.6 trgligerides off the scale was in shock at that time i had the a1c written down tho i knew my sis would want that   test results today a1c 6.0 tri 226 chol 210 ldl 133 hdl 32 and kidneys (micro albumen ) clean 20 lbs lost since july though doc wants me to lose more(we'll see i'm just aiming for more strength, endurance and endorphins) doing better thats great thats marvelous
my a1c's have been between 6.0 and 6.3 ever since i started and i feel wonderful&hellip;no more spikes and lows
my total daily insulin usage has actually decreased by using a pump and i've gotten my a1c's back into the 6's
i need my a1c down its gone up to 9.3% :( it works great for me ,a lot better then 12 to 17 shots a day
tml english hi im kenya in  34 yr old i have been type diabetic for 8yr,my a1c recently was 9.6 so i was put on insulin after not being responsive to oral meds( metformin glyberide) i have been using victoza started in april
last a1c (3 weeks ago) was 5.7) that is awesome
namaste -steve i just had my a1c done it and was down to 6.0
my last a1c was 6.9 which is ok but i'm working on getting it still lower
my hba1c is sitting at 12mmol/l which is extremely high
but for some reason now the numbers are getting crazy again i think alot of it is stress the kids are getting out of school tomorrow and i have had alot financial worry as of late i usually dont let things bother me but right now i think everything is working me up my last a1c in may was 8.6 which it up from the 7.4 it was 3 months before
i have been diagnosed for almost a year and my a1c is down from an original 10.2 to 5.4
i honestly believed i was going to miss rice, beans, ice cream, chips, potatoes and for the past 2 years i indulged like i really did not care&hellip; well i paid the price of course (a1c =12) but now that i gave all this up do you know the only thing i miss
my a1c is 6.5
so even though my a1c may be 7, it does not mean i have not had 300-400 bs readings and my lows just bring it down to look good on the average
n 2011,so they starting checking my a1c,at that time it was 6.1%
a1c was 5.7 he was diagnosed as a t2 in september of last year
tml english well i finally got another a1c test done not doing so good, my last three are 9.4,11.4,9.4
ldl cholesterol was 192 now 131, all the markers for stroke or heart attack are down as well from 3.1 to1.2, a1c went from 9.4 to 7.5
i had an a1c of 10.7 and was admitted into the icu
i was taking 4 shots a day and checking my blood sugar all the time&hellip;   i have been able to get my a1c down to 6.4 and was switched to metformin last week, by a new and wonderful doctor
she was just at the doctor and her a1c was 9.5, yes she is rebelling and does not like doing what she is supposed to when it comes to taking control of her health equating her anger solely, exclusively with her blood sugar though "understandable" (from narrow perspectives), is a serious mistake
the a1c results are in and were very close to being a diabetic they said something about 6.4, i'm not sure what this is, so now i'm being sent for another test, fasting, and to drink that milky liquid and hang out for 2 hrs blood-work every 30 min
6.4 is good and the other test will tell if u r a diabetic or not so do not worry about the 6.4 it just states that ur bg has been good for the last three months a1c is not a home run test for diagnosis however 6.4 shows you have a problem
my last a1c was 6.6
i have done much the same kind of meal plan (i dislike the word diet) where i eliminated my twice daily injections of nph insulin, maintained my bg levels in the "normal" (80 to 130 mg/dl) rabge lost 65 lbs, and had an a1c of 5.5 for quite a while
my numbers were a1c 6.3 and fasting bg 105
my latest test ( 11/11/15)  is a1c: 6.0 and fbg: 102 my question is with all the weight lost and eating mostly vegetables, brown rice, eggs and nuts, i though my results would be lower
a1c is an average found in your blood recording 3 months
an a1c of 6.0 is just above the range of non-diabetic which i believe is 5.8
an a1c measures the glucose levels in your blood over the past 2 or 3 months
when people drop from an a1c of something like 10 or 9, it is easy to drop it into the 7&#39;s pretty quick
my a1c was 6.6 and my fasting bg was 74
my a1c is 6.3
has happened to me when going from glyburide to glipiside &amp;metformin should have informed physician immediately my a1c went from 9to 13 and am now on insulin physician said i was passing almost all my sugar now 25/5 , 5 ,15/5 i would wait no longer to inform your dr
as far as my a1c is concerned my last test towards the end of september was a 5.2 and my daily blood tests are consistently (knock on wood
3 months ago i had an a1c of 15+ and most readings in the high 300's
my a1c was 11.9, i'm afraid of starting the meds because i heard it's worse of your bs is too low
heidi perhaps i am missing something here but &hellip; unless you have reason to distrust your doctor i would start taking the meds immediately as an a1c of 11.9 is very high (avg
my a1c was 11.6, which is startlingly high
the thing is, i'm trying to get my bg under tighter control cuz me and my hubby want a baby :) but i just can't do that right now, cuz my a1c is at 6.5
i also have kidney stones stuck in my bladder and ureter that causes constant uti's, which then affects my glucose going way too high; hence, a new all time high a1c of 9.3
my previous a1c was 6.2 and then my last a1c was 7 and my triglycerides sky rocked up
i told my doctor that my bs checks were going up for a couple of months but since my a1c was 6.2 and it was close to taking my next a1c we waited
after i got the a1c of 7 he adjusted my insulin and now my bs is back down and so are my triglycerides
the dashboard shows your average bg levels and your a1c&#39;s and you can even put your doctor and lab info in there
i am doing well last a1c was 5.2  lost a few pounds i now weight 173
he told me my hba1c was 9.3mmol (australian) and that my fasting glucose was 13.5 mmol
tml english ideal blood glucose before eating is 70-130 mg/dl ideal blood glucose at bedtime is 100 to 140 mg/dl blood glucose that indicates hypoglycemia is 70 mg/dl blood glucose that calls for ketone test is 240 mg/dl a1c target is 7.0 percent or lower low risk ldl cholesterol is less than 100 mg/dl low risk hdl cholesterol is higher than 50 mg/dl low risk triglycerides is less than 150mg/dl low risk blood pressure is less than 130/80 mg/dl ty
i have been able to maintain my weight at 120 lbs and my last a1c was 6.8 with lipids in the normal range
my bg levels are  generally in the normal range, my a1c is 5.5 and my weight has dropped about 40 lbs
i am under very tight control 3 weeks ago my a1c was5.4
tml english i have brought my sugars from 300 plus and my a1c from a 11 down to a 8 in like 30mdays or so, but now all of a sudden everything has leveled off and i am running 125-157 or so
this, above all else, has kept my a1cs between 5 percent and 6 percent
tml english i was diagnosed with diabetes 1 year ago (may 2013) a1c of 14 and put on insulin &amp; oral meds
steve i've not changed my eating habits and last a1c was 5.8 which was 1 point up from previous result before oral meds cut in half
tml english hey guys,had a1c done thursday, call me down to 7.1 i am trying for under 7, wish me luck, have great day way to go keep up the good work you are at 7.1, you are not far from your goal
aren't the same people that are recommending high per meal carb counts also saying that an a1c of 7.0 (or even 6.0) is acceptable
normal blood sugar and an a1c below 6 should be the goal in order to be healthy

james yes at the moment i am depressed as my a1c was 11
if it keeps happening he should let his doctor know because it could be his medicine is not working well and they need to change it or something that he is eating when i was diagnosed my vision was very blurry too,until i got my blood sugar down it took me a couple months,low carb diet and metformin,i thought i was going blind,i didnt even know what a carb meant when i was diagnosed now i look at everything,my dr told me eat what ever you want but never go over 60 carbs a meal,which at the time i thought was impossible but it is very easy before long i was eating less and less carbs just by looking at packages,my first a1c was 10.8 now im at 5.8,ive lost 60 lbs since june,it is so scarry when you are first diagnosed ,i love diabetic connect so many people are so kind and will love to help you along your journy of learning to live with diabetis when i was first diagnosed my bs was very high and my vision was very blurry
my a1c came back 14.3
the doctor says in 3 months she wants my a1c down to a 10
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
he does not believe he needs insulin (his a1c last year was 16
i have recurring pancreantitus so they have been checking my a1c which was at 280
all that and keeping my bg levels under 130 mg/dl and achieving an a1c of 5.5 without injecting any nph insulin
when i was young doctors did want to say that you were because inssuance problems but  you never be type one it always cosited type no matter what meds your on it can go in to remission but always have it good luck i stated there to  now i take two pill three shot a day i constatly cheak sugers and count everything my suger yo yo  but a1c stay constant type 2 can never turn into type 1
my last a1c are 5.4,5.4,5.4and5.5
if i was doing what she wanted me to do i would be extremely underweight, have a bad a1c, be spiking well over 200 after each meal and generally be in poor health
what is more i my may 2011 a1c is 5.5
in er his highest blood sugar was 880 and a1c was 14
his bs went to below 130, and a1c  to 5
this week his new doctor was happy to announce his a1c was 5.8 and bs 130
(a1c was 13.2 at that point)   i did not get a meter until about 6 weeks after diagnosis&hellip;my pcp did not give me one, and i waited for my endo to give me one&hellip;or to instruct me to get one
about a month ago, my a1c came back at 9.2 - about two months after diagnosis
i will also have an a1c below 6.5, preferably below 6.0
my self is maximum for  fbs is 155-160 and   ppbs is maximum 180 noticed rearly   generally my fbs is  98 -112  rearly 125-145   and ppbs is   110- 145  rearly 170-182 when i was diagnosed a month ago my bg was 457 and my a1c was 11
when i was first dx'd mine was 892 and my a1c was 17
the a1c chart only goes up to 13, or that is what i was told
and through all the years, i rebelled a lot and my a1c wouldnt drop from 15%&hellip; im proud to say im at 5.8% and gunna keep it that way
my docs lab for a1c goes to 18
for the past three years my a1c has remained in mid fives with daily reading between 85- 125
for the past three years my a1c has remained in mid fives with daily reading between 85- 125
for the past three years my a1c has remained in mid fives with daily reading between 85- 125
for the past three years my a1c has remained in mid fives with daily reading between 85- 125
for the past three years my a1c has remained in mid fives with daily reading between 85- 125
i went to see my primary dr  heordered blood work and found out my a1c was at 7 so he started me on metmorphin 500 mg 3 times a day and i lost a bunch of weight went off the meds and now i was diagnosed as a hyopglycemic so my numbers go high and low and back to normal but thats the only medical attention i had
a1c is 13 and my bs started at 389 - down to 260 at the moment
3637-a1c-s-6-0-or-less-recommended-in-this-study
intensive treatment meant trying to keep hemoglobin a1c readings at 6% or less with at least three insulin injections a day or an insulin pump
om/ i have managed to get my a1c from 13.3   9 months ago down to 6.3
despite that, i have never had a a1c below 7.1
i think my next a1c will finally hit below a 7
tml english i have been on basal/bolus regime for about 14 years now, with hba1cs regularly coming out somewhere in the 7s
my a1c was 7.4 and trigs were 484
my a1c was 7.4 and my doc put me on metformin 500 mg 1x daily
my last a1c was 6.8 and i'm expecting the next one in august to be lower
i have lost 28-29lbs, also doing ww and going to the gym, and my a1c went from 7.9 in dec
also my a1c, which was 5.6 at the time-and she wondered why i was even put on it
well, today, 3 months and 8 pounds later, my a1c is 6.4
i've been all worried about that a1c test but i guess a 6.4 isn't bad
here are the target ranges in mg/dl:   for adults:  before meals 80 to 130; bedtime/overnight 90 to 150 and a1c of &lt;7.0
for 13 to 19 yr olds:  before meals  90 to 130; bedtime/overnight  90 to 150 and a1c &lt;7.5
for 6 to 12 year olds:  before meals 90 to 180; bedtime/overnight 100 to 180 and a1c &lt;8.0
for child &lt;6yrs old:  before meals 100-180;  bedtime/overnight 110-200 and a1c 7.5-8.5
ad a good report this last doc visit my a1c went from 7.4-6.4 i must be doing something right but i might be in trouble next time cause i might have rewarded myself too much and too long so now i got to work on turning things back around again in the right direction
i will tell you though that using it has moved my a1c from 10.5 to 6.4 in 3 months of continuous use
i have since normalized my bg levels and lost 65 lbs, and achieved an a1c of 5.5
before i delivered my a1c was 5.3 and now im at 6.7 which i was never at until after pregnancy
i was told by my tat artist (who's girlfriend of 14 is diabetic) that he will not tat anyone with a a1c over 8
and i mean i have been bad&hellip;my a1c came it at 6.3, another shock
i initially had an a1c of 6.7
my a1c at that time was 7.1 with a 3 month follow-up of 6.9
my last three a1c's were 5.4 , 5.4 , and 5.5
i've not used meds for 3 years now and i am in the normal range of blood glucose (80-120) and a1c is close to normal (5.7)
my initial a1c was 11.3 and by july it was down to 7.2 then in oct
using the pump enabled me to get my a1c's back into the 6's after it had crept into the 7's
er bs averages  had been in the 270s for over a year, with an a1c of 10
om    what i share on the site and in the book are what got me from an a1c of 20.9 and close to death to blood glucose and a1c as good as a non-diabetic
my last a1c was 5.0 without meds
(i am a 5'3",  65 yr old female, moderately active and have been able to maintain my weight around 120 lbs with my last a1c at 6.9
my last a1c was 6.8 and i'm expecting the next one in july to be lower
last a1c was 7.4 and i need/want to get that back down below 7.0
although my last a1c was 6.4 which was up from the one before
my last a1c was 7.2 and i am hoping for a reading below  that
i go in for a check up and a1c tomorrow (friday)&hellip;and it just cracked me up to see that everyone is doing the same thing right now&hellip;wondering what that a1c is going to say
lowered my a1c to 6.8, lowered my cholesterol 10 points, only 10 more to go and i'll be at 100 and not have to start taking meds for that&hellip;and my blood pressure was 100/70&hellip;which they said was good, i need to learn more about what those numbers mean, i never paid attention before, but now i want to know
i don't think i've ever had a a1c below 7, and as far as bein lazy, lol, the other day, i just 'happened' to test, and what to my wondering eyes should appear, a result that wouldnt come up on my meter
anyway i had my a1c last week and it was 6.4 the same as last time 4 months ago
my last a1c was 6.2 and i had been doing really well
my last a1c report though was 6.3
today, i just got an a1c reading of 4.7 that is five and a half months after diagnosis (at time of diagnosis my a1c was 13.2)  i have also lost 7 pounds since then
i do know i am not ever buying an a1c test for 20.00 to test myself
i had thought about the self test a1c so i would be curious on how your doctor checkup a1c matches against the home test
tml english i'm a 76-yo male, diagnosed four months ago with type 2, with an a1c of 10.1 pct
since then i've lost more than 30 lbs and my a1c has gone to 6.0
well, not necessarily diabetes, though your a1c should be under 7% if you are trying to get pregnant
i need to get my a1c down from 7.2
if i were in control my a1c would be 4.5
it could certainly be hormones &hellip; or stress &hellip; or the weather &hellip; or maybe just because you are diabetic ;) well controlled type 2's seem to be quick to point to "dawn phenomenon" as the cause for slight elevations in morning bgl's &hellip; an average of 120 would be an a1c of 5.6 or 5.8  but we want to hit the panic button when we see numbers that would give us pretty darned good a1c's &hellip; imo if you start seeing 140's or better on a regular basis then you need to explore taking action
for instance, my boss is t2 and his a1c is 5.5
tml english went to the doctor today, and my a1c is down to an 8
now my bs is in the low 100's and my last a1c was 6.5 that was 3 months ago
my a1c was rising up to the 10 level, and stayed there for months, until very recently
my a1cs were like 9.7 when i went to the doctor
for example, since you stated that your a1c was 12.5 three months ago and now it's down to 8, ya gotta tell us how you did it
i personally am very interested as i will get my next a1c test at the end of this month and my pa doesn't think it will be much lower than a 9, and i started at 11 at the first of this year
you should be  pleased that  your a1c is now down to 8
13003-what-s-the-proper-fasting-for-the-a1c-4-6-or-8
when i did a1c years ago, there was a 12 hour fast before hand as i recall
tml english hey guys thanks to all for support when a1c was 9.2 got physical today down to 8.2 i am really working more aware of my diabetes excercising more i know everday is a great blessing but next may 4 i will be 65 and i hope to still be blessed in ady vance thanks to all
like neverlowbg says my endo also does my a1c in the office but if my failling memory serves me right you can take your average bg reading and there is a formula or chart that tells you about what your a1c is its not acuate but gets you in ball park ask jaybee52 or holaboy they will know the website they are two of the most informed people ive met here on dc and have learned allot from them they are great guys i  think  you  can  add  up  all  the  b/s  levels  for  60  or  90  days  and  divide  it  by  the  number  of  levels  you  added  up  and  that  will  give  you  a  ball  park  figure
i don't know if there is a home kit but my endo does it right in her office with a finger prick no lab but once a year to check everything and to keep co pays low that once a year lab i send to all my dr so i only have to do it once for all five of them i call and they put in order for labs so i do them all at same time i hate needles so i get it over at one time but a1c endo does every three months i walk in they test my bg bp and a1c ten minutes later endo talks to me checks my feet looks at my a1c looks at my pump stats that i download to her every week and makes any adjustments needed i used to spend a ton on co pays but learned tricks to get them way down used to pay around 500 a month now around 150$ a month and that's mostly to pharmacy my a1c was 5.9 this time  but need to lose 35 lbs and stop drinking diet pop  since twisted my knee yesterday cant walk since it hurts so now have to go figure what to do till knee heals yuck you could go to youtube and search for seated exercises, seated yoga, and seated tai chi
hey james restlesdiabetic is looking for a home tester for a1c i dont know if there is one that would be cool if affordable but i think i remember you had a website that you took average bg reading and it got you in the ball park of your a1c can you pass that along again thx charles you  can  get  them  at  wal-mart  for  around  $30.00 thanks guys i was looking at them that might be kinda cool to have thanks for the suggestion charles,  i just was responding to what shorty said about twisting her knee
om/ip/relion-a1c-test/105
i am still trying to get my a1c number down from 8.5  i am not doing well but i have started working out with beach body program to get moving and help with the number
but the good news is my a1c is at 6.9
tml english this is to just introduce myself, i was diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes last february 2014, i did nothing about it but take lisinoprl 20/12.5 for the high blood pressure, this past february i had my annual check up and took note of my readings, hba1c 12.3, blood pressure better than last year, this year brought home to me that i have more than likely been  diabetic for probably 10 years or even more
just had my hba1c retaken after 3 months and it's down from 12.3 to 6.2 :) i dieted cut out potatoes, pasta, rice, junk food, chocolate and heavy laden carbs will update with all the other information as i get it
that was almost 2 years ago since then i have lost  40lbs and last 4 a1cs were 5.4,5.4,5.4and 5.5  walking helps alot and portion size meals and lots more vegs
i was diagnosed 18 months ago with an a1c of 15.2 and my last test came in at 5.4
god's best to you   james my new a1c was 5.5 which is awesome
sept 8 - glucose, a1c, blood pressure, bmi oct 13 - tsh, blood pressure, bmi, glucose, cholesterol (total and hdl), take-home breast self-exam gel packs   you can find out which clubs are participating on which dates here
i have been good, a1c 5.0
my a1c was 5.1
tml english my a1c jumped up to 7.3 so the doctor has put me on victoza
i try to be pro-active in all my treatments and my a1c's are great after only a year of diagnoses,  but the pain from the arthritis and now the nuropthy in my toes can keep me up at night and from enjoying my daughters' activities&hellip;and i am only 46
tml english hey guys hubby went to diabetic educator yesterday she put him on another metformin now he on 2000 a day so with us walking hopefully he will get better control a1c down to 8.1 but he is walking 3 times a week thanks for all the support
3 months ago my a1c as 7.0
that said&hellip;i started out, march 31, 2015 - with a fasting bg of 388 and a a1c of 13.2 when my labs got drawn thursday last week, by fasting bg came back at 101
and today, my a1c came back at 9.2   additionally, i have now lost over 34 pounds in the time since my diagnosis&hellip;form 304.5 on march 31&hellip;to 270.4 today
i lost weight rapidly, cholesterol was perfect, a1c went from 6.8 down to 5.3 in about 6 months or so, blood pressure as low as 80/48, and healthy as a horse
not only am i keeping my blood glucose (bg) levels in or close to normal range without the use of antidiabetic meds of any kind, had an a1c of 5.5 (gonna need to have one done again) and lost 65 lbs last year
my a1c is 5.7 and my bgs are 80-125
thanks,  but i have precise control over my bgs (a1c of 5.7, bg range of 80-120 on any day) and haven't use any medications for the last 3 years
i cut out fats and sugar and lost 80 pounds and had my a1c drop from the 14.3 at diagnosis to 6.3 in six months
i have stayed with the diet that worked for me and i have never regained the weight or had my a1c get as high as 6.3 since
i'm not on any meds for diabetes, and just got taken off my statin (this is a 3-month trial) and my a1c just came back a 5.7, so i'm happy
my a1c is 5.2 so i don't get why i'm having this pain
any ways last august i went to the doctor and my a1c was 12.5
the three things that you perhaps did not emphasize are:  1) that delaying going on insulin because of the fear of the pain and bother of injections can be very detrimental to some of the patients with diabetes who also suffer from other serious illnesses such as immune disorders;  2) the use of insulin syringes, a1c tests, and diabetes testing supplies can become quite costly and prohibitive for patients like myself who still do not have healthcare coverage but are not quite yet eligible for medicare; 3) use of insulin and the concomitant weight gain poses risks as well and i seem to be getting more of the symptoms and disability of hypoglycemia when ever my blood sugar goes below 100 (even though that reading is considered part of the normal range)
since i have gotten off insulin i have lost over 50lbs and kept my a1c below 6 good number on your a1c, and i congratulate you on losing 50 lbs
lowest hga1c was 8.0 interesting&mdash;see,when i drank some, i did not have diabetis, that has developed only in the past 3 years, but i tend to love fruit juices&mdash;so guess that is a no-no- too,  pr hi dana,   we need to get together and have a party
but, not before i lost 60 lbs and my a1c got to 5.1
at around 80 to 130 mg/dl and at one point achieved an a1c of 5.5% and lost 65 lbs over a 5 mo period
my a1c was 6.4
i have lost 65 lbs over 5 mo, had an a1c of 5.5%
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
my a1c is down to 6.1 so i really want to keep it as it is, or lower more if possible
today i got a a1c test and it came back 6.9 down from 7.7 which that was the first one after i got on insulin
this is no miricle  pill, if there were then and a1c of 6.7 would not appear on any diabetics bloodwork
before starting on the pump (3.5 months ago) my a1c was 11.9 and now 7.9 so i'm pleased with how much its come down in those 3.5 months
hoping to be under 7 on my next a1c 4 months ago a1c was 5.7 my fasting is around 84-90  was taken off of bp meds after 3 months of power walking mon-fri  3-5 miles a day
also take 134mg of fenofibrate every day for cholesterol but in double blind study of type 2 patients if has been shown to improve kidney function which means lesser chance of kidney failure a1c about 4 months ago was  5.7 i take metformin 500mg x2 a day
also due to exercising biking 6-10 miles on the weekend and power walking mon-fri doctors took me off bp meds it has been a week and avg bp i 115/72 resting pulse rate 52-60 bpm i just recently found out that in may 2011 my a1c was 5.5
i haven't had an a1c that good since i became a person with diabetes in 1995
my last a1c was 6.5
my a1c is 5.7, down from 11.4 8 months ago, my blood glucos is 97, down from 250, i take metformin once a day 500 mg
my a1c is 7.1, just rec'd that number yesterday
my a1c is 6.3 as of last week
a1c last week 5.2 6 months ago 5.6 and 3 months before that at diagnosis 13.2 my a1c is 7.6
my last a1c was 6.9
5.2 a1c cholesterol was 117
my a1c is still 5.3
well 6 months ago my a1c was 10.4 and now it is 6.4 as of 2/14/2011
my goal is to get my a1c lower of course, but to also change my insulin back to the u-100
hugs when i was first diagnosed, my a1c was 9.0(nov.2010)
my a1c is now 7.8 as of jan
my a1c was 9.6 and was up from the last time i had it done
my a1c earlier this month was 5.8
~:-) my a1c was 8
at last tick - a1c was 8.9 - my doctor is not pleased
hope to have better numbers overall - i've had a1c as low as 6 and as high as 10
my a1c was 11, everything else is perfect
my a1c is 8.8,my cholestrol is 199
at time of my dx on nov 2009, i was 6.8 about 5 weeks later, it was 5.7 3 months later it was 5.8 (darned fish fry's during easter)   my last a1c was at the end of july 2010, and was 5.3 &amp; that was with spikes into the 200+ range too
once i learn how my body reacts to the environment, food, and lifestyle, i will be able to get my a1c down to between 4 and 5
for those of you with an a1c that is above 6.0 for a year or more - talk to your doctor about getting lantus
my blood pressure went up 50%, and i expect my next a1c to be 20% higher here in 3 weeks
kevin last time my a1c was checked it was about a 8 to a 9 but that was good considering it was a 13 to 15 about a couple years or longer back i am going to the dr today to find out what it is now&hellip; i havnt been to the dr
at that time, my a1c was 6.2 and my triglycerides were 606
hemoglobin a1c is a blood test which gives you a 3 month average of your bg#s for 3 months
my last a1c test results were on may 12th of this year
i started at a1c 8.3, currently at a1c 6&hellip;very pleased i am dropping, no meds, diet and excercise
seeyuns, nicki my a1c was 8.0 in august
i have not gotten my a1c checked since august but at that time it was 10.8; the medication that i'm taking is called janumet and the dosage is 50/500; and believe it or not the last time that i got my blood pressure was 120/72
my a1c is 5.9-6.0 most of the time
i check packages and try to buy stuff containing 5 or less of sugar my most recent a1c was 6.0 (end of august)   i am using 1.8mg of victoza daily&hellip; it has really leveled out my numbers
my most recent hba1c is 6.9 on 9/7/10
happy friday&hellip; as of 8/27/10, my a1c was 5.9 and i was taken off of the amaryl i had been taking
my a1c last month was 5.2 hello' my a1c was 15 8-26-10, how can i get it lower
warm hugs&hellip; my a1c came down from 7.8 to 6.3 as of last thursday
i am embarassed to type this, but to no fault of my own my a1c is 17.3
my a1c, this time was high around 9.6, my doctor increased my glyburide from 250 mg, to 500 mig
and what levels should bs be at before you call a dotor only been taking medication for 4 days my last a1c was 6.4, down from 7.0 6mos
my last a1c was 5.5
he had told us that bolusing 10 minutes before meals was shown to lower a1c by 1%
my a1c's have gone down nearly 1% as well&hellip; from 7.9 to 7.1 after i first started doing it
i thought my latest a1c would be much worse &mdash; i'd had so many infections during that 3 month span that i felt they'd been out of whack
i have been taking my humalog just prior to eating and my last a1c was 8.1
i find by eating no more than 120 grams of carb per day, i am able to maintain a reasonable weight and keep my a1c's in the 6's
a1c dropped for 9.7 to 7.9 still having high levels
anyway, after 3 months his a1c went from 9.9 to 6.9, and with the extra effort of watching his diet, this was a very good result
my a1c is 9.9
my blood glucose was going up and up until my a1c was at 15
my last a1c reading was 6.1 i  just   started  it  and  it  does  lower  my  sugars im   trying  to get my a1c down  to  7  my  dr  has me  on long lasting  insulin  and  half  a tab  befor  dinner of  glipizide     im  hoping  i  can get  it  to  where  its  supposed  to  be at   im  off  the  metformin  and my  colestrol  med  becuse  it  made  my  liver  enzymes  go  very  high   i  just  had  a  liver  biopsy  done  and  they  said  i  have  cerrosis  and  they  want  to  treat  it so  my  hep  c  can  go  away and  then maybe i  can  get  a grip  on  my  diabeties
6 months ago my a1c was down to 7.5
when i was first diagnosed i was an a1c of 7.6 i was put on the lowest dosage of glipizide once i got my diet under control i started going really low so i spoke to my dr and he recommended i get a pill cutter and only take half so i did that
my last a1c was 5.8 pretty much with out medication :) at the start i was put on glipizide and metformin and after 2 months i was taken off glipizide when my a1c went from 11 to 5.4 but i'm still on metformin
my a1c has always been well below 7
my a1c was 12.2  he immediately added 20 units lantus at 9 pm  the problem iam having is iam scared to take it
i have been having trouble to, and it want load up a profile pic, the cropping will not do right, your best bet is get your primary to give you a referral, then have your endo monitor your a1c every 3 months hi cherokeemaiden just wanted to add
went to my doc and my a1c was 10.5
before surgery my a1c was 7
my a1c was 6.2 and he wants them to be &lt;6.0
around 2010, i started seeing increased a1c's and, for the first time it got above 7.0
i am surmising it is type 2 since my hemoglobin a1c was 7.4
best wishes harlen this is what helped me   feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
a1c tells what your blood g has ben over a period of 3 to6 months so is a very good tool
i have however gotten my a1c down and lost a load of weight in the last 2 years
tml english i was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 3 weeks ago with an a1c of 11
but i never confirmed that with her or her drs   god's best to you james my doctor told me a month ago that i have type 2 diabetes mellitus based on a fasting serum glucose of 213 mg/dl and a1c of 10.5 percent (implying a 90-day average serum glucose of about 250 mg/dl)
if you're type 2 and on a drug and your sugar is not in the 100's, then your meds are wrong, or you're consuming too many carbs for the dose&hellip;and you really have to get your a1c into the 6's as quickly as possible, or bad things will happen
i am trying to get my a1c down to 5
i was also on 15/500 actoplusmetformin and had side effects so i insisted that the doc change my meds; however, my bg was down from 356 to 125 and my a1c from 13.1 to 7&hellip;all in 90 days
my a1c stayed high over 11 for around 6 years
my last a1c was 5.9
the a1c test was done ( level 9 i think ) yet no one bothered to explain what that meant other then scare me with omg thats way too high as if i knew i was diabetic
i do test and know my bp however :) lost 30 pds thus far so i am hoping to get a better result, thanks for the great post a1c will tell you (better yet your docotors) how good of control you have had on your blood sugars over the past 3-6 months
tml english for monitoring glucose control, a1c is currently reported as a percentage, and it is recommended that diabetics aim to keep their a1c below 7%
the report for your a1c test also may include an estimated average glucose (eag), which is a calculated result based on your a1c levels
the closer a diabetic can keep their a1c to 6% without experiencing excessive hypoglycemia, the better their diabetes is in control
in screening and diagnosis, some results that may be seen include:   a nondiabetic person will have an a1c result between 4% and 6%
diabetes: a1c level is 6.5% (47 mmol/mol) or higher
pre-diabetes (increased risk of developing diabetes in the future): a1c is 5.7% - 6.4% (39 - 46 mmol/mol)   *****the interesting part to me, that i did not know before, is the 4% - 6%
i know for sure i am full blown diabetic, my numbers were high enough on the fasting blood glucose, but&hellip;according to this, an a1c of below 6% is like a non-diabetic
i had a fasting bg of 115 and a1c was a 6
a true non-diabetic a1c is 4.6-5.4 based on the studies that have been done
a1c from 10.4 to 5.5
my a1c is still showing that i'm running in the 140 range on average, but hope, too, that will go down
my a1c is 6.5
you still want to try and get the a1c down, although good compared to others, the high bg is showing up in the a1c still
my a1c is 5.7
my a1c is 5.7
which after all was the ultimate goal of the experiment)&hellip;i went out and bought a home a1c kit&hellip;my a1c prior to starting was 5&hellip;my home a1c results were 4.9&hellip;exactly the same as the last home test i took&hellip;and that was with&hellip;adding more fruit&hellip;non starchy veggies
i've lost 19 pounds since christmas and my a1c went from 6.4 to 7.1
your a1c is compilation of your blood sugars for usually a 3 month period
good luck to you my last visit my a1c, 6.6 and i am hoping to keep it there it takes works and staying on course, i have it for 12 years and mine still goes up and down you have good days, good months, then you have off days, just keep workinig at it and you will suceed
my initial a1c was 8.7 since then about 1 yr ago it's been 6.6
as for me, i got my a1c down with 30 mins of activity per day
connie4849 still off metformin  a1c 5.6 one bad day is allowable as long as you don't over do it
my a1c is a 7.4 (went up .4 from three months ago) so my metformin has been upped to 1000 mg twice a day
my a1c goal is to be below 5.7
tml english i was diagnosed with type 2 last march with a a1c of 7.4
i was diagnosed in july 2008 and my a1c was 9.6 at the time, i too was put on metformin and a 9 carb a day diet and now my a1c is 6.2
i keep my a1c at 5.5 watching the ingestion of wheat (i certainly don't eliminate it) and usually temper the intake with some fat, such as butter or cheese
i feel i am managing my blood sugar fairly well, my a1c is 6.3 and i try and keep the numbers in the low 100's
her a1c for that period was 6.0
i do not get my a1c1 checked but every 6 months
my a1c was 6.1 in may and now it's 6.4 it has not gone up that much
my a1c went from 6.5 to 6.9
most of us work hard at our health, obviously your doing something right with an a1c of 6.4
20521-hints-to-improve-a1c-for-type-1s-and-those-that-use-insulin
i didn't do to good bec my a1c always was 10, it took a long time and insulin to get it to 7.1 and i'm still trying
my sugars are well in control my last two a1cs were 5.4 and 5.3
ask dr to let you manage your diabetes the way you have been only without the medication and then do your a1c within the 3 months to see how you're doing
my a1c dropped from a 12.0 to a 5.7 at time of visit my fasting blood sugar was 101 that was 80 days ago
for my blood work at time of my test my 12 hour fasting bg was 63 and my a1c was 5.5
thank you congradulations on your low a1c, grainboy1
i was able to drop my a1c from 14.2 to 6.7 in 90 days, but it took my being willing to seek out the classes and resourses available to me
my last a1c was 5.4, trying to get it lower than that
my august, 2015 lab work showed a jump in a1c from 7.9 to 9.1, and fasting bg was 171
fast forward to the end of september, 2015 lab work: my fasting bg had dropped to 114, and a1c to 8, all in just one month
this translates to an a1c of below 6 for the nearly two months that i've been self-monitoring
:-) n=1 i took a low dose of pravastatin for 1 year and my a1c went from 5.9 to 5.8
at the time of diagnosis, i had a fasting sugar of 388 and an a1c of 13.2  that was march 31, 2015
i was what you might call pre-diabetic for years&hellip;my doctor was forver warning me about it, and monitoring it&hellip;i'd see her, and my fbg would be like 110 and a1c of like 6.5 - and so i just decided my doctor was being an alarmist and no big deal, right
i'd maintain that the 6.5 a1c and the 110 fasting bgl were your ticket to our club &hellip; a you just decided not to join us then :( don't place too much "weight" on a single reading &hellip; particulary as a new member of the club &hellip; there are many factors that can raise bgl besides your last meal
it wasn't until after my stroke and i got extremely serious about staying alive and got a doctor willing to listen to my research and theories that i got my health where i felt it should be &hellip; ideal body weight, 15% body fat, ideal cholesterol ratios, normal blood pressure and an a1c of 5.7
i have in the past year gotten off all diabetes meds, have maintained my blood glucose (bg) readings at or close to the "normal" range, have had no lows, my last a1c was 5.5, and i lost 65 lbs over the year i have followed this eating plan
one thing she did tell me was that her a1c is i believe around the 10-10.5 range but i am not sure what that really mean
she told you her a1c is in the 10 to 10.5 range
a normal person's a1c usually runs somehere around 4.5,  well controlled persons with diabetes (pwds) usually have a1cs in the 5.4 range although t1s may run in the 6s or 7s and still be considered in good control
this is what mayo clinic says: "for someone who doesn't have diabetes, a normal a1c level can range from 4.5 to 6 percent
someone who's had uncontrolled diabetes for a long time might have an a1c level above 8 percent
when the a1c test is used to diagnose diabetes, an a1c level of 6.5 percent or higher on two separate tests indicates you have diabetes
a1c is her average  bg levels over a 3 or 4 month period
that being said i'm not saying that to blow smoke&hellip;i've lost 96lbs &amp; my daily readings &amp; a1c are well within "normal" avg daily 99, a1c 5.3
before i was seeing her my a1c was 8.0 in december, when i was still seeing that quack
since seeing the pediatrition, my a1c is now 5.6 and she cut me back on the glipiziide
my last a1c was 6.8
my bs is between 100 and 121 and my a1c is 5.4 to 5.7 (i use the formula to get the a1c)
my a1c is 7.5 which is right for me
my last a1c was 6.3
i exercise regularly and my initial a1c was 7.5
if your a1c is over 4.5 then i believe your a diabetic and nothing can change that
20442-a1c-brought-down-to-less-than-6
tml english i successfully managed  to bring down my a1c to below 6
s got my latest lab reports today, a1c at 5.7
i've had my a1c at 4.9 and became way too comfortable these past holidays
after purchasing the wii fitness board, i had my a1c done 3 months later and it went from 8.3 to 7.1 in 3 months
y blood hba1c was 9.1% last wk &hellip;she wants to see it between 6 and 7 % at the very least&hellip;yesterday i decided to start a veggie raw diet , with the exception of steel-cut porridge and berries in the morning and raw fish every other day or 3 times weekly&hellip;so i shall follow uri elkaim  www
if this continues, i expect to see my a1c drop down below 6.0 for the first time since my diagnosis 18 years ago
think twice about pushing your a1c below 6&hellip;it may cost you some abnormally low sugars (which has been my problem&mdash;which can be very dangerous)
my a1c went from 5.8 to 5.5 in three months
i have been drinking a locally made tea blend of cinnamon and peppermint (with a lil  brown sugar) and my last hba1c is 4.8
last a1c was 6.3) don't know if cinnamon is worth crediting&hellip;but it isn't hurting
said let's try diet and exercise, my a1c has come down, from 7.0 to 6.2, that was 6 months ago, my blood glucose is in the range mornings anywhere from 95 to 115, after dinner anywhere from 140-180, but i never feel good, that's why i'm thinking would i feel better if i went on medication, i'm up half the nite going to the bathroom, isn't that cause there is still glucose in my blood
my a1c has went from 7.9 or so to 6.5
tml english i'm newly diagnosed with type ii, a1c 6.5
i am still working on getting my a1c down below 6&hellip;i am at 6.9 now and at one time was a 12
my wife then took me to an emergency doctors office and he told me then my a1c was 14 and my sugar was close to 600
anyway two years ago i went to a new doctor and he found my a1c was 11.7 and he nearly fainted
my a1c had dropped to 7.1
since that time each time my a1c has been approximately 6.7
that was her a1c that was a 12
two years ago they started testing for insurance, a1c was 6.2, then i started glucocil, a year latter 6.3, at that time i stop using any known sugar, i replace sugar with nu stevia, stop all carbohydrates, ate only protein, nuts etc, kept taking glucocil, added greek olive oil and bitter melon, and this year a few weeks ago a1c 5.9  i plan to start using cinnomon and chrominum with bitter melon and see what happens
my a1c was 5.5, i lost 65 lbs and my fasting bgs were around 100 -120 mg/dl
a1c now 6.6 have gone down to 6.2 as well
on a good note, i had my a1c checked after 3 months of monitoring and making adjustments and happy to say the i went from 11.5% to 8%
my a1c was 7.2, the best it has been in at least a coule of years
diabetes runs in my family so i have always been careful of what i eat and my a1c had always been in the good range (6-6.5)
13, 2011 i was admitted to the hospital with a collapsing airway, and the iv steroids and other medication they gave me to open and keep open the airway raised my blood sugar into the 500's and my a1c tested out at 9.5  (three months earlier on routine tests it was 6.5) so really before the hospital stay i can't say i had any symptoms but since leaving the hospital (and just getting off another two week burst of steroids/insulin) i find myself dying of heat/sweats, passing out when not really tired, and having issues with my eyesight
of course i later understood his reply was based on my a1c being 12.46
my hba1c has never been higher than 6.3 since i've had the cgm; my last was 6.0
i'm getting my a1c back into the 6's and have many fewer low bg episodes
the pump has been my salvation a1c was good up until about 6 months ago
my a1c has been under 6 for several years now and i am still tweaking my diet as my goal is to have an a1c of 5.6 or less
my a1c as of 3/27/15 is 7.3
i just went to my endocrine yesterday and my a1c was 11.1
hugs over those 12 years i've had a1c's of over 10
switched me because my fasting levels were high and my a1c was 8.2, but since the switch it seems harder to get the levels down
usually if your a1c is below 7 and your numbers are not too high, they will do a 6 month follow up
my numbers run high and my a1c was 9 this last visit
when i was first diagnosed my  a1c was 17
and the first year&hellip;i struggled to eat better, but my a1c hung up at 11.2 to 9.5
my a1c has been in the 5.0 to 5.9  for over 10 years, except for a 4 mo
that true ,it took a while to get that high so it will be a process to get it back down my last two a1c tests have been 5.8 and 5.4
i just got my test back for my a1c and it was the lowest, 5.4 fantastic diane wtg girl, please continue your good work
i have had high blod sugars for a couple years and my a1c is at 11 i take janumet and lantis pen she ups the pen almost every other time i visit
after 6 months, my a1c went down to 6.3, i lost 20 pounds, my blood pressure was 122/70 and i was first able to reduce my glyburide/metformin dosage by half and as of last week, i have lost another 10 pounds and my doctor is cutting my medication to metformin only
my a1c stays at 5.8 to 6.1
my endocrinologist encouraged me just today to raise my a1c from 6.2 to 6.5
hi msann :), if your a1c is 9.5 the only way to get your number down is to seriously get a grip on your diet
mtngal   i was diagnosed last year with an a1c of 14.1 and fasting blood sugar 366
my last a1c was 5.4 back in january
my last a1c was 5.4 which i was thrilled about&hellip;but the only thing that i am not happy with is i have a lot of low readings (50-60)
best wishes harlen thank you harlen any time this is what i did and my a1c went from 14.1 to 5.9 in 4 months and has remained below 6.0 ever since
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
since my a1c has been staying around 6.1 i feel i'm doing ok
tml english my hemoglobin a1c went from 9 to 5.3 in 5 months
time tested medication that actually has protective properties&hellip;i waited till i had 3 consecutive a1c test results under 5.5 before going off my meds&hellip;one test result is just that
at that point, my a1c was 10.7 and fasting bs was 271
well, saw her today, 3 months after my diagnosis, and my a1c is 6.9, cholesterol is now 150 (was 177 even though i was taking twice the meds i'm taking now) and triglycerides went to 82 (from 151)
i had stopped lossing weight well now i am back on track i have lost 3 pounds in a week i am so excited so now in almost a year i have lost 48 pounds and my a1c is 5.9 yeaaaaa woooooooo
i also do yoga twice a week and have managed to maintain a1c's in the low 5's without medication
a1c in the low 5's with out meds  takes great look at it as domestic biking
i was on 140 units of lantus (70 at night and 70 in the morning), i was taking about 150 units of humalog a day (more or less) and still had an a1c at 9.2
they just checked my a1c last week and i was at 6.4
my a1c has gone from 10.5 to 8 in a matter of 3 months, so my doctor is happy, but i'm not
he took meds and insulin but still thought he could eat whatever he wanted&hellip;his a1c was 13 before he died
i don't know how to compare it to my a1c which is 6.6
per the chart in gary scheiner's "think like a pancreas"  an a1c of 6.6 would translate to an average bg reading of 135mg/dl to 140mg/dl or around 7.5 mmol
my last a1c was 6.8
after my last a1c (5.8) i feel confident my food plan is working and just focus on working the plan every day
thanks eva yes &hellip; from walmart when i get my labs they also check glucose level &hellip; it's part of the comprehensive metabolic panel, i have that, hba1c and  lipid profile done every 3 months
congratulations on the a1c down to 5.8 and 4 lbs down
a1c is down to 5.8 was 6.8 last time
your a1c has improved and you lost another 4lbs
my a1c's for the past two years have been 5.3 or better&hellip;so the condition is far more complicated than one standard conclusion
i had my last test a few days ago and my a1c was 12 and my fasting sugar was 254
numbers were almost perfect a1c was like 5.9
last check on a1c back up to around 7
my original a1c was 12.5, and even then, i was only taking 4-6 units per meal, and 19 of lantus at night
test once every day(average for 30 days) 115, last a1c 7.0, and never had test reading 180 or higher
a1c is down to 7.1 from 7.5 in may
at first i had bg (blood glucose) levels in the normal (80 to 130 mg/dl) range and had an a1c of 5.5, and over the first 5 months i lost 65 lbs
my a1c is 5.7 plus i exercise every day
revrr i am a recently diagnosed diabetic &amp; am looking for good recipes &amp;and  ideas my a1c went from 9 to 6.2 , still need to lose a bit of weight &amp; would love some new recipes to add to my new lifestyle to keep it fresh
two years ago i had a stroke and they discovered that i was a type 2 diabetic and had sleep apnea as well as being morbidly obese (that one wasn't news to me)  since then i've lost almost 100 pounds by diet and exercise and my a1c which had been as high as 9.7 is not under 6
my docotor says to get pregnant you need a hba1c of 6 and i am at 7.5 and can't seem to get down more
a1c could be better 7.9
and after all my good work these past few months getting my a1c down to an 8 from a 12, all blown out of the water by steroids to treat pneumonia
then i was called 2 days ago and told it was not type 2 it was pre-diabetes, this came because her a1c was normal at 5.3, however we were doing random checks, once maybe twice a week at most on her and she had readings over 200 several times, i found out from another doctor that they should have done a ogtt on her, we moved and feel the ball was dropped by previous caregiver, anyway, we have a new ped endo in this state now and she is actually going to see her next week and will have the ogtt done then, its oral glucose tolerance test, a 2 hr test
folks, i've gone from a starting a1c of 16.2 in january of 2015, to *drum roll* 5.7
since i started taking it seriously again my a1c has been a 5.4 and i have gone from 215lbs down to 160 lbs
i started out 304.5 pounds, fasting bg of 388, and an a1c of 13.2   /in the nearly four months now since my diagnosis&hellip;i, too, learned much from here, and learned how to stand up to my healthcare team, and take control of this apple cart
last check, two months ago, my a1c was down to 9.2 a four-point drop in just two months&hellip;i expect much better results next time out&hellip;i had not hardly begun the course i am now on
good job :-) very nice&hellip;that is some dip in a1c lady&hellip;you should be proud&hellip;and i am very glad your doctor wants to use your experience to help other people&hellip;i have come to the conclusion that the only way to change the way type 2 is dealt with by doctors is for people such as yourself to be vocal advocates of the lifestyle they follow&hellip;i make it a point whenever a med student is around ( i go to lsu clinic which is part of a teaching hospital) to tell my doctor (knowing the medical students are observing)
and bring my a1c down to 5&hellip;scream it from the roof tops&hellip;at anyone who will listen&hellip;i have said a thousand times&hellip;to the point where i am sure people are sick of hearing/reading  it
i had started in feb 2011 with a new eating plan which manages my diabetes without the use of diabetes meds with success at keeping my bg levels around the normal range and my may 2011 a1c = 5.5 and i lost about 50 lbs too
it sed my a1c was 6.4 and my test at the doc's  was 6.4 so i do like it and now i only test at the doc's every 6 months they do test for other things as well so it is a good thing to get tested at the doc's  best wishes harlen the problem with a newly diagnosed person testing their a1c is that the average could take your readings back to non-diabetic days
your doctor will probably want an a1c in 3 months from now, not 3 months past
have managed to keep the a1c in the 6's and avoid complications all these years
my average a1c is 6.4 and 6.5 which are not "bad" enough for medication
hank a1c is an average of 3 months, so one or 2 bad days won't make that much of a difference
(and my a1c has lowered to 6.7  this year&hellip;hopefully will keep improving in the future) switch to the pump&hellip;but get the omni pod pump
nor do i have the desire to play one on tv&hellip;(unless i am cast with john stamos as my love interest)&hellip; my a1c is 6.1, but my dr
but if i had an a1c of 6.1&hellip;i would not take insulin&hellip;i would work on the diet
tml english i am so happy  i got my a1c down 1 point without going too low and i do not have gastroparesis doc says i am doin good but would like me to reconsider going back on the medtronic pump, i am thinking about it linda when i first tried the pump i was recovering from brain trauma &amp; it seemed too complicated, but there has been a lot of progress there too linda hi - good for you
ol so i cut my carbs back as best as i was able and my a1c started to go down the better i got at counting carbs the better my a1c was weeeeeee
went for bloodwork again in may my a1c was 11.6
wonderful side effects are weight loss, doing ww and exercising too, and my a1c went from 7.6 to 6.1
i have maintained an a1c of 6.0-6.2 for 18 years with diabetes
my a1c was off the charts a few times, but i did get some that were around 14
i got the scare of my life when i got an a1c of over 14, and being at about 5 now i'm working hardest i've ever worked to keep it at this point
tml english semi good news for me my a1c aint anywhere near as high as i thought im in the hospital battleing a ulcer to keep my foot my a1c is 11.3 so i think they said my sugers are like 200/350 when better then 440 threw high 500s feeling good about that howdy ray
my bgs are still well controlled as is my a1c @ 6.1 after about 1 year of my new diet
my a1c is 5.5, been maintaining my bg levels at or close to the normal range, and even lost about 50 lbs
no meds, and an a1c of 5.5
so can yall tell me if a a1c of 6.8 is good or not please
i also just found out that my 3 month a1c is 6.7 so you keep up the good work
just have to limit myself&hellip;works most of the time&hellip;managing to keep a1c at 6.4&hellip;but struggle
thank you, lori :o) god bless a1c does not have to be fasting thank you kindly kidsmomof9
non-diabetic folks can have a1c&#39;s in the mid 4&#39;s and if you get there you are a saint
i started with an a1c of 11 something, my endochrinologist is very proud me
the results are that i am back down to 158 lbs, have an a1c of 5.4, and ran a marathon personal best a couple of weeks ago
i heard from my doctor today and she said i am due for my next a1c in 2 weeks
its like everything else everyday on the news some "expert" is always informing us everything that is bad to eat or it can cause this or that well i have found that moderation is the key for those of you with type 1 follow your doctor's advice to the letter for my condition which is type 2 weight control and exercise along with proper portions of any foods seem not to wreak havoc with my numbers sure i have a spike after eating regardless of what i eat but i feel the key is that this spike quickly recedes due to exercise and weight control in otherwords as long as this spike does not stay high for extended periods of time simple walking, 2-3 miles a day works wonders i have been practicing this method for over a year now and my a1c numbers have been vastly improved i am not saying that it is alright to eat eggs everyday or anything for that matter in excessive amounts remember you can eat large amounts of carrots each day and gain weight and we all know and are aware of what excessive weight does for a type 2 diabetic sure if you have a piece of cake everyday or candy i guarantee you will experience adverse effects & have a poor a1c number but if you exercise and control your weight you more than likely can indulge once in a while depending on how severe your diabetes is how one should determine the path to follow remember everyone is different and reacts accordingly if very severe, yes you must stay completely away from bad foods until it is definetly in control if you have what i have, type 2 (insulin therapy) (insulin as needed) and control my daily number moderation and portions is the path i follow i found along with my doctor that oral meds were not as effective so thus the insulin therapy my a1c number was 11% and is now 6% losing 1-2 pounds per week can be acheived relatively easy without the heavy stress i was able to lose 30lbs and wow what a difference in my daily numbers and that was acheived with portion control along with walking but it does come to a point whereas the exercise portion of any program must be increased as once you reach a stablized plateau weightwise it gets harder to lose additional weight without increase in activity you may be eating properly but you will find that is not enough i eat egg whites mo of thste time
my bs readings are good and my a1c came down 8 points eating my eggs
metformin did a lot to keep my blood glucose in order during a 2-year study i did with the university of minnesota comparing gastric bypass surgery with intensive medical treatment to lower a1c's in t2 diabetics
my a1c was 6 during the study (which was below their goals although i know not as low as it should have been) down from 10.5 when i started
my a1c has gone up from 5.6 to 6.0
my previous a1c was 8.1 and this one was an 9.9
thanks moegig :) a1c down to 6.6 from previous 7.1 and 7.5 before that
i eat a high protein, low carbohydrate meal plan and have been able to keep my fasting blood glucose (bg) levels under 130, have an a1c of 5.5, and lose 65 lbs (and keep it off)
i will see if this is helping on my quest for an a1c below 5.6 soon as i have blood work scheduled in about 3 weeks
i'm type 2,  and tho my numbers really fluctuate, my newest a1c is 6.6 but cholesterol is high
this is a great question, and the good news is that keeping a1c under 7 and overall good diabetes management helps prevent these complications
she was always nonchalant about her diabetes&hellip; i would stress over my a1c being over 7% and sue would say "oh&hellip;mine is 11%" with no concern in her voice
my a1c was at a 8.9% and i was on nuvaring birth control at the time
i took an at-home a1c test the other day and in less than two weeks, my a1c dropped from 8.9 to 7.9 (a whole point
35442-a1c-below-6
tml english my last a1c was 5.6 and my doctor told me it had to be above 6
she says there are studies that show people with an a1c below 6 and an a1c above 13 have the same morbidity rates
my endo seems happy with my current a1c of 7.0 but that's not stopping me from trying to get it back into the low/mid 6's
all i have to add to this conversation is &hellip;mazol tov&hellip;med free is the way to be &hellip;grin&hellip; as counter-intuitive as it seems there is evidence to suggest that as we get older (65+) an a1c between 6.0% and 8.0% is actually "safer"
congrats on the "normal" a1c and getting off meds &hellip; were i you and was able to stay under 6.5% without medication &hellip; i'd be happy
a year and a half ago my a1c was 9.6, down from an all time high of 11.4
when doctor put me on it my a1c was 12 my bg was 181 i take 500mg with breakfast and 500mg with supper untill 2 weeks ago when i got sick wow
mary i was diagnosed july 15 2011 had sugar in my urin and  my a1c was 12 and my bg was 181 doctor put me on metformin that day 500mg with breakfast and 500mg at supper so been taking it up untill 2 weeks ago
my a1c remains steady at 5.7, and i've lost over 40 pounds (i do love food)
my a1c is 5.4
follow up was in may and my a1c had dropped from 12.46 in january to 5.78
my last a1c was 6.5
i have had over 2 years of consecutive a1c's in 5.4 or lower
i've since tightened up my bg control with my last a1c at 6.9
my last hba1c was 6.9 and i weight 123 lbs
i just got my new hba1c result and i am now up to 7.0 from 6.9
my a1c was 6.8 that day
a1c was 6.8
the diabetic counselor said that 3 months ago my cholestrol was high especially for a diabetic, so they plan on ordering new bloodwork since i have changed my diet and my a1c was 8.7 not knowing i had diabetes
i've always aimed for bg's between 80-180, and that results an a1c for me in the 6's
tml english hello to all, i went to see my pcp yesterday and she told me that my a1c went from a 13 to a 10
19421-a1c-is-12-5-help
i have recently brought my a1c levels from 11.3 down to 6.2 in two months
i was diagnosed last year and through diet and exercise i am able to keep my a1c at 5.1
:) my first six months i dropped my a1c from 8.4 to 7, still working on getting the scale to move which is frustrating
i have had great success with my meal plan, and had achieved an a1c of 5.5 and pretty well normalized my blood glucose (bg) readings
i have now kinda backslid on some of my consumption and i would think my a1c is not 5.5 now
tml english i just found out that my a1c is now 7.4
i hope to emulate you as my recent a1c was 8.1 and i am praying for a bigger reduction next time as well
last week my a1c came in at 7.5 and i came down from a 9.0 in octorber
praying god's richest blessings upon you and yoursw   james baker thanks hi :)  i assume you are giving a1c #s&hellip; so 10 equates to a bs of 212 and 9 equates to a bs of 183
in three months he lost 50 pounds and lowered his ha1c from 12 to 7
their a1c is less than 7.0
e/umhlbpptlry ) all i have ever heard is that you can avoid complications by keeping your blood glucose "under control" when i asked what "under control" meant i was told an a1c under 7.0, 6.5 and finally 6.0
so &hellip; 8 years ago i was diagnosed as a diabetic with an a1c of 10.0 6 months after it was 5.8 and has remained within .2 of that ever since 4 years after dx i lost sight in left eye due to a detached retina (which they attributed to diabetes) 6 years after dx i had a hemorrhagic stroke (which they attributed to diabetes) 7 years after dx i was diagnosed with "severe motor and sensory neuropathy of the lower limbs" (which they attributed to diabetes) and now 8 years after dx they have discovered early signs of retinopathy in my right eye (which, of course, is attributed to &hellip;) all of which really makes me wonder &hellip; what the hell do i have
my a1c went from 10 (when i first found out i was pg in jan) to 8.3 last month
works great&hellip;last a1c, 6.9 good for you hope all works out
ad good news yesterday- my a1c is 5.7%, three months ago it was 6.1 and the one before that 6.3 see you are still quilting-that's good
your a1c should be less than 7% i started off on 10 units of insulin (humulin) and was told after 3 days if readings were too low or high i was to adjust the unit amount by 2 units less if reading was low or 2 units more if reading was too high after another 3 days do the same etc until you get the readings steady
my a1c is 6.7 which is low enough (my doc tells me)
i know sounds like a lot of info, imagine having to do this for four months for every piece of food that went into yoiur month, how much insulin you gave yourself, what your bs was and if you did not check it why not, and the like, not fun, but it got me from a1c's in the great then 11's to a1c's in the 7's
i don't think that a1c under 6 caused the deaths
in my view the low a1c numbers, below 6  in the accord trials did not cause the deaths as you say
then they were drugged down to a a1c below  6
the goal is to have a1c below 7
i'm currently at 7.4, the a1c before this was 10.8, so i'm improving
the gastric surgeon wont touch me till i loose some weight and get my a1c from a 10.8 to an 8 or below
my a1c went from 12.5 to 8.5
what is your a1c (that is result before this started i assume), what were the numbers correspond to 105,95 from before
have not check my a1c for a while an it was around 7.5 with insulin it will be another month for my next blood test&hellip; the docs say if your nums stay between 80 an 160 you are in the normal range
here our test strips show the same numbers as the a1c tests do in the states, but you have to multiply that number by 22 to get the reading in the states
y readings have always been good, and my a1c is below 6
tml english hey just would like 2 share that my a1c has come down from 14.1 to 5.7 with in a years time,well time 2 go put my 5mile walk in thanks
great job on the a1c and the 5 mile walks
bet you thought you were a walking time bomb with that a1c of 14.1
yes insulin 2 times a day,pot chloride 2 time a day,&amp; metformin was 2 times aday but due 2 my a1c comming down doctor told me to take it 1 time a day now
i will try that  our my a1c is 12.5 just trying get it together this years u can do one day @ a time just do a little each day, one mile a day &amp; just go from there each week add 2 it
i have lost over 100 lbs and my last a1c was 6.9
she point blank told me that my a1c was 13.8 and that it was almost a 14
the only thing i could maybe think of on the a1c is trying to reduse your carb intake for me my limit is 30-40 carbs a meal your might be a little more or a little less
you have to remember that an a1c is a test that dr's use to get an average of your bloodsugars have been for the last 3 months
my a1c before i started pumping was over 8 and my first a1c after only 1 month of pumping was 6.6 and my first full 3 month test is coming in about 2 weeks i can't wait to see what it will be
a1c is a 3 month check of your blood sugar
the a1c this time is back up to 8.0 the bp was 120/80 pulse was 80 weight was down 3# cholosterol was almost upto 300 again the bad stuff
for the loooooongest time my a1c was always right around 7 (sometimes a little bit over) but in time it did start to drop
i have had my last 2 a1c results at 5.6
my doctor ordered my next a1c  to be done in 2 weeks, so i will save the home test for later
i have had the g4 for 2 years now lowed my a1c from 8.4 to 6.3 in my first three months i'm waiting for the g5 because it has a share app and my husband works off shore this gives him access to all my data and can help me even from way out there
his last a1c reading was 12 and he woke up and his blood sugar was 210 that morning
my a1c is 6.5 i don't think in my case it is diabetes related i just don't need much sleep
of course i am a type 1, so i am not really sure if type 2 folk get a1c readings the same as type 1 folk
the main goal is to get your a1c in the 6's&hellip;no higher
i started with an a1c of 14.7 and within a year i was down to 5.7 and i'm maintaining
and put on 2000 mg of metformin&hellip;it is now feb and i am down to 500 mg with an a1c of 5.9
my a1c is 5.1 and i feel great
ihi spacey, welcome &hellip; i've been dealing with this for going on 8 years now (come may), i am taking 500 mg of metformin (glucophage) 2x daily but will be reducing or eliminating that depending on next a1c (if lower than current 5.8)
my last a1c was a 5.8
i did decide yesterday to go back to what was working for me to keep my numbers under control, my a1c was 5.9 my average readings were about 130-which considering what they had been before that upwards of 300 was fantastic and i was feeling so much better :)
the a1c shows what its been as an average over the last 3 months
the a1c on the other hand is more of a long-term view of what&#39;s been going on with your blood sugar
my a1c was a 14 then
in august i went back and my a1c was 6.8
my a1c was a 8.5
oct                     jan a1c                      7.2                      6.1 total cholest
tml english saw my doctor on saturday, my a1c was 9.1, up from 8.8
he was on three different insulin,  two diabetic pills and a hemoglobin ha1c of 10
i know i don't have to, but i did manage to go from an a1c of 7.7 to 6.5 pretty fast, and i think it would be amazing to be in the fives
unfortunately this disregard of food intake resulted in a weight gain, though my a1c remained below 6.2 for this 10 year period
it is a constant struggle for me to discuss a1c with anybody, as, i can't really relate to an accurate a1c hardly at all
i have lost over 50lbs and my a1c level is 5.3, so i must be doing something right
i have lost over 50lbs and my a1c level is 5.3, so i must be doing something right
tml english sorry i just had to tell i am too excited i just got back from the doc's and my a1c went from a 10.5 uck when i was first tested and today its at a 6.01
my blood sugar was 206 and my a1c was  11
today my blood sugar was 84 and my last a1c in april was 5.9 from diet and vitamins only
my a1c went from 14.1 to 5.9 in less than 4 months and my fasting blood sugar went from 366 to almost normal numbers in less than 2 months
my last a1c last month was 5.2
i mainly wanted to do an update because my 30 day average blood sugar level is 223 =9% a1c :d so my blood sugars are definitely improving (before the glipizide i was at 11.3 a1c) i have my 3 month a1c at the end of next month and i am hoping that my a1c is down to a 9
last a1c was 6.7
the drs office called me today and said my a1c was 11.4 which sucks cause that means my sugar has been running between 300 to 500 and i know when that happens it causes a lot of damage to your organs
now my a1c is 6 which is normal
a1c 13.6; glucose 390
a1c in jan 8.9 last week a1c= 6.7 oh yeah if you try the cgm it sucks and it hurts to insert and still have to test 4 times to calibrate so i threw it in the drawer and medtronic gave me a tester that talks to my pump it's wonderful hear that you're feeling good and that the pump is working so well for you
with more than 120 events each year i stayed in shape, never slept better at day's end and my blood sugars stayed at a healthy 5.7 a1c which pleased my doctor no end these days walking three to five miles really helps keep my blood sugar in a healthy range of rarely more than 200 and mostly from 150 down to 90
have so much low blood sugar finally got switched to another kind&hellip;a1c after 90 days was so low my md wanted to put me on oral medications and i said absolutely no
i am not on medication and have a decent a1c average of 6.4 - 6.5
my bg numbers are good, so i'm hoping for an improved a1c next month at my 6-month checkup
my a1c for the last 2 1/2 years has ranged from 5.1 - 5.5, little changed, even after i was taken off metformin a few monthes ago&hellip;are you still following your cde's meal plan
i'd like to have a1cs as low as yours, so i may try a 100 carb/day diet for awhile if need be after this next dr
i have kept my blood sugar down my a1c was 13.0 and my sugar level was 326 in june of 2009
while the a1c gives an overall average of your blood sugar levels for the previous 3 months, it's not a mathematical average of the blood sugar tests you do
that may be something you're going to have to tweak for your own body's metabolism)   as far as your question on a1c, your a1c could be gotten through your dr ordering a blood test for a1c at 90 days, or later after your last a1c
but since it is only an average of one's testing points (and the a1c is a 24/7/90 average) the figured average could be quite off
i asked her to check my a1c today and the good news it has not gone up since the last time, but the bad news is it's 8.7
with a fasting level of 117 and an a1c of 6.3
i hit 300 at times and my a1c was 6.4 last week
(any suggestions) ive been reading&hellip;when i was first diagnosed i tore my kitchen apart&hellip;and was put on metformin&hellip;and i can say it worked well for a very long time&hellip;my average a1c was 6.8 &hellip;   have you gone to a diabetic class yet
my initial a1c was 12.4
my last a1c was 5.6&hellip;but weighing is the correct way to know exactly what's on your plate
last a1c 5.7 a bit high for my liking but its been a hell of a winter on the east coast
i've lost 54 lbs in the last 10 months doing this and my most recent a1c is 5.8 so something is working
i eat 'em all the time and my hba1c is in the 6.5 range all the time
i've been blest with perfect a1c  for 3 years since my first bad one when i discovered i had diabetes
tml english got my labs back a1c test came back at 9.3 down from 11.9 in feb
i have reached a point where my sugar never goes above 120 and my a1c is in the 5 to 6 range
one time when i was in the emergency room, one of the people that drew my blood said " i see you have an a1c of 5.9
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
i when to the doctor this past monday  &amp; my last a1c was 12.90 , but  now it came down to 8.9 now
3399-new-a1c-10-9-to-6-1-in-3-months
not sure &mdash;-pr my last a1c was 6.4 but my individual numbers are scary
my goal is to get my cholesterol below 150 and my a1c now below 6 bp is stable so its looking good
got my a1c down to 5.4 and now it's back up to 9.3 urgh
sometimes the doctors don't know either they try's to find out what's the best doses u should be taking as well but they not in side our body to k how it operate 100% because my doctor had me on 15untis of novolog 3times aday with sugars 300-422 and 25unirs of lantus 1 time at night and it did not help me at all i k i need more doses of insulin  so i stop see her and i start giving myself 50units of novolog and my a1c went down from 12.6 to 10.83 &amp; my new doctor put me on metformin and i see a big difference in my blood sugar  just find out what's best for u and then u let your doctor k what u think and see what he/she says cuz the are never 100% sure believe me and good luck hun just give your self the dose your doctor said to take u k your blood more then what they do so if u feel like u need more or less then the doses he said to take then do so cuz u have to find out what doses are best for you&hellip;alone with eating what's right for your body thanks ec what type of insulin was it
a1c is 7.3, now i am also on anti-depressants  anyone else have these problems or suggestions
last a1c 6.1
i see my endo at the lsu diabetes clinic on friday&hellip;he is also giving me my first a1c&hellip;and i am a newbie to diabetes, but even i know that some people can be surprised by their a1cs&hellip;our testing only gives us little windows&hellip;and me
btw, my a1c has been in the 6.3 neighborhood since 1996
avandia was making me swell&hellip;metformin was causing me to black out, and i was taking prandin which was my last and it just wasn't even lowering my bloodsugar and doing the same thing metformin did&hellip;my doc put me on inuslin in january of 2011 with just lantus&hellip;now its novalog and lantus with an a1c of 6.8&hellip;and i feel much better&hellip;no dizzy spells or stomach pain etc etc i as well are on novolog &amp; lantus
this week i got the results from my a1c test, and my number dropped from 7.8 to 7.2, and the metamucil was the only thing that i had changed in the last 3 month, and then not on a regular basis, only when i would think about it, maybe once a week, one or two weeks 3 or 4 times those weeks
this i check at 06:30 and my a1c was 134 which is 7.3
i just check it at 14:10 and my sugar was 110, which is a1c 7.3
when i was watching my bs, my a1c was 5.5
i quit checking it on a regular basis and my last a1c was 8.3
additionally, an a1c is an average of what your bg has done 24 hrs a day/7days a week for 3 months
however i have just learned that the a1c is more heavily weighted toward the average bg in the preceeding 2 to 4 weeks before it was taken
there is another calculator of a1c i have found, but this one has a chart of average bg numbers related to the a1c
looking at the chart there, your a1c of 6.9 corresponds to an average bg level of 168
my last a1c was 11.3 last week
my last a1c was 6.9
when diagnosed 7 years ago my a1c was 10% &hellip; within 6 months it was 6.6 and within 1 year of diagnosis 5.8 &hellip; i have been at or below 6.0% ever since
to that end i have dedicated myself to lowering my a1c to under 5.0
since changing to a very low carb diet, i have brought my a1c down to the low 6's
a1c test measures a 3 month period and is done by blood test
;)  donna you're welcome&hellip; your readings sound a bit strange as a1c is done on a 3 month scale - i
12 or 13 is high&hellip; your a1c should be 7 or below&hellip; aic is the average insulin level reading for every 3 monhts
on an extremely bad day for me is when i get my a1c tested and it's a 13 my doctors are "yelling" at me
a1c is short for "glycosated hemoglobin a1c"  it is a test which is generally done every 3 months and it gives an average of what your bg numbers have been doing for the past 90 days
here in the us we use a different metering standard than many countries around the world,   as far as a1c numbers go 7.9 is easily an indicator of diabetes
my most recent a1c was 5.5, which is considered "normal", but i most certainly am a diabetic since i have had an a1c in the 9s before
my last a1c was 6.6
new pcp mine my doc of 22 years retired, put me on lantus 26u numbers under 200 (135-250) a1c down from 16.5, 14.5 after only 10 days of lantus to 10.4
my dr told me my vision would improve once i got my sugar well under 200 and she recommended  not getting my new prescription until my a1c was better so instead of getting my eyes checked until 4 months after dx and a1c was 5.5
remember the goal, keep you a1c in the 6's&hellip;that's all that counts
i attended those hospital classes and even though i am disabled &amp; can't exercise, i still do my darndest to keep my hga1c between 5.2 &amp; 5.9
lol i am jealous of my husband because his a1c is 5 and i'm 8
i have searched some sites but find different opinions of what is  normal a1c  and high a1c levels
pretty sure this is not subject to opinion &hellip; "normal" people have a1c's under 5.7%
what is subject to much debate is what a person with diabetes should keep their a1c at (for me the answer is simple &hellip; normal &hellip; duh)   steve normal means normal&hellip;5.6 or under
although most healthy people are in the 4's&hellip;i don't like the idea or someone being told they are perfectly healthy with an a1c of 5.3 or 5.4&hellip;they are just steps away from being pre-diabetic&hellip;which is a condition that i don't even think should exist&hellip;you are either diabetic or not in my humble opinion&hellip;you are either having insulin sensitivity  issues or you are not
i need to get my a1c down, loose 30 pounds and exercise everyday like i used to
when i was on shots my a1c ran around 11
my a1c has been a record(for me) of 8.2 and i'm working hard to bring that down to 7
when i was on shots my a1c ran around 11
my a1c has been a record(for me) of 8.2 and i'm working hard to bring that down to 7
while my a1c numbers have always been very good, below 6%, i really failed that fasting glucose tolerance test big time
and even though my blood sugars were somewhat under control (a1c's always being in the 6.6 to 7 range) i was starting to put on a lot of weight
(my 1st wife divorced me at 25 yrs, my 2nd wife died after being married for 2 yrs)  my a1c hovered at 6.5 to 6.9
doing this i not only was able to discontinue my insulin but also lost weight and my a1c went down to 5.5
even though i am always in great control of my blood sugars, (a1c's are between 5.8-6.9) and generally good health (gym 4x/week, 120lbs at 5'4") these things happen
long store to short&hellip;my a1c was 10.2 and fluid was building up
my a1c was over 14
and ive been try to excerize and eat healthy and it was 5.0% for my secoud a1c test my first one was 5.4%
my first a1c results came on thurs&hellip;mine was 6.1 that is fantastic
my 1st a1c was off the charts but my last test a month ago was 8.1 so i have a little bit further to go
my may a1c is 5.5 and i lost 50 lbs without really even thinking about it
i'm going to try this starting tomorrow since its sunday and i'll be home when i was diagnosed my weight was 265 and my a1c was 11&hellip;yes it was and now that i have more knowledge to help with what is going on i am now at 6.5 but my weight is 234 and bounds up and down 1 or 2 lbs i would love some ideas on how to get down 10 or 15 lbs
puts you in better control of your diabetes that why plus thats more like normal range my last a1c was 6.4 and my doctor told me it was to low so what is the norm
you will see that a non-diabetic a1c is 4.8-5.6
my first a1c was 5.7, second was 5.4, haven't had another one since
with an a1c of 5.0% or even 5.4% like your first one , you are not diabetic, not even borderline diabetic
i am, and my first a1c ws 5.7 3 yrs ago next month
my second a1c about a year and a half ago, was 5.4
yeah, for me my last a1c was an 8.1
just got my latest one this week&hellip;a1c6, beginning one 19 mo ago 8.4&hellip; my first one was 8.4&hellip; i go in december to test again
haven't had my a1c done since may 2011
my a1c was 6.8
my a1c 6.6
anyways like you, this caught me as a surprise as i was never even showing signs of prediabetic&hellip;( according to my health screenings) i'm in my 30s and was a bit overweight but my family at home is very overwhelmed with me, they can't accept my diagnosis as i am barely doing now(8 months later) i was such an emotional wreck but i am feeling much better as time goes on :) i was prescribed metformin the first month i was diagnosed but since my diagnosis i have an a1c of 5.4 (dropped from 11)
under control a1c seems to go between 7 to 7.7 this morning, 178 fasting why does it seem to me that everyone in here is perfect
and my last a1c was 6.0 on 12/31
visit on 2/13 &amp; a1c lowest in 6+ years
i still have lots of weight to lose, &amp; lower numbers to get to, but a1c has gone from almost 11 to 7.5
my a1c is 5.1
my last hem a1c was 9.7
as a type 2 i was able to get off my twice daily insulin injections, maintain my bg levels at 80 to 130, and achieve an a1c of 5.5
tml english hello,my a1c test was 6.6,i do have stage 4 copd and congestive heart failure,he put me on glimepiride an it made my suger level go up to 260,man i wa feeling really bad,so i checked online and it can interact with the lasix i take,so then he put me on metformin,which i seen i shouldnot take it with heart failure,i want to just try an watc what i eat an recheck,my lowest reading before breakfast is 102 after is 166,before dinner is 126 an after meal is 176
i just spoke with my gp nurse and we are going to retake and a1c test in 3 months,cause i advised her now i know what foods and drinks raise my suger level,s maybe diet will help,i cn,t do much exercise cause i,m on 6 lpm of oxygen 24/7 and have only 27% lung capacity left,but she said since i,m not taken any med,s my blood suger level needs to be under 140 at all times,any higher and i will start doing damage to my organ,s&hellip;from what i was reading it should be at wake up 70-130 and after dinner 180 or less,but she said thats only for people taken med,s and since i,m not it needs to be 140 or less,i,m new to this diabete disease only been diag
my next a1c was 5.5, and within 5 mo dropped 65 lbs
my blood glucose at the time of detection was 415 with a1c at ~ 15%
my last a1c reading was 8.7 %
tml english so i went to the doctor for a1c&hellip; it was ok 7.0
my a1c was 8.5
my doctor was against it, but made a deal with me that if i could drop my a1c by at least a point in 3 months, he'd let me stay off it if unless i didn't continue the trend
my a1c level was 8.9 and my daily sugar test was 1200
he should take his a1c at least every 3 months to keep tract of it as well as check his sugar at least twice or more a day
by the way now my a1c is 6.0 and my regular sugar never gets higher than 159
(last a1c was about 8
my a1c is always in the 6's, where it should be
the one exception is the a1c test they do locally, it only takes 15 minutes, and they have me wait, then give me the results
i get a call my dr the next day with the lab and a1c results&hellip; my doctor calls me in a couple of days with all my results, including my a1c
this was ok but then in april when i had my a1c tested he increased the dosage to 4 a day
i brought my a1c down from 13 to 6.3 with this combination
i really wanna get my a1c down from an 11% because i would like to have another baby
my last a1c was 6.6  its up some from last time
ever since i got out of the hospital and was able to take my diabetes under my own control my a1c hasn't been under 6.5
'm not sure how she determined it that's just what she said because the sugars were out of control (a1c 11.7 ) it looks like i have a lot to talk about with the endo
tml english i am newly diagnosed, as of june 2014, my a1c was 7.2
my a1c was greater than 14 (scale does not go any higher than 14
my a1c was 6.6% last time it was checked
i have not gone to a review board yet since i am waiting to get my a1c until i am at least 3 months out of the hospital
but between exercise and diet it has been low and i am expecting an a1c in the 5-5.5 range based on my numbers and the fact that my a1c a month ago was 6.3 when i was only 2 months out of the hospital
i have gotten my a1c down to 6.1
as stated already a diabetic can not enlist, but if diabetes is developed while in the military they may stay in if their a1c is below 7.1% 3 months after diagnosis i think
my a1c stays 7 or below and always has
i still achieved my best a1c of 5.9 (back in 2004) while using mdi&hellip;don't know if i'll ever get that low again
your a1c has to be at or below 6.0 or else it's a super high risk pregnancy
basically she said that it's highly recommended to be on a pump and if you can get your a1c down to 6 or lower the better chance you have to have a successful and healthy pregnancy
just diagnosed - age 49, 250 lbs, h1a1c6.6
tonight's dinner &hellip; large tossed green salad with a homemade peppercorn mayo  and yogurt dressing 2 1/4-pound hamburger patties onion and mushroom sauteed in butter i'm still addicted to food &hellip; good food   steve age 61, 170 lbs, hba1c 5.7 that sounds so flipping good i started out with no potatoes,pasta, and bread
my a1c is steady at 5.2
my current a1c is 5.8
i am getting my a1c's back into the 6's with the last one 2 weeks ago at 6.7
yeah, my last a1c was over 10
as others, after being diagnosed 5 years ago as a type 2 with an a1c of over 12 and blood sugar levels that would only register as high, and testing 4 times a day, i now only have to test once a day and i change off everyday from the morning to the evening
currently, my a1c is at 5.4 and my bg never spikes above 155
luckily, we can keep her a1c at around 7.5 which is not bad for a type 1
20355-a1c-11
tml english what did y'all do to get y'all a1c down plz help me my a1c is 11% and i would like to get my a1c down to 6% tell me what did y'all do
my a1c was 14 something when i was first diagnosed
yes the ppl are very helpful howdy lanessa   i got my a1c down to 5.5 (from somewhere in the 6-ish area) and managed to lose about 65 lbs and manage my t2 without the use of diabetes meds by following this meal plan ~  http://www
my last a1c was 5.9  28/09/09  started at 12.2 in dec o8 my a1c right now is 9.0  so if i can get mind down to where you have yours &hellip;i will feel a lot better&hellip;my doctor want me to get to at least 6.0&hellip;so if i have to go on insulin&hellip;then i will give it a try&hellip; i guess you are right about the diabetes going up&hellip;because i started out on something small
or would i be able to get off of insulin, when i get my sugar level in control right now my a1c is 9.0  i brought it down from 11.0 this is why i didn't know if i should go on insulin
below the chart is a conversion device wher you can enter your a1c and get your estimated blood glucose or enter your meter number to get an estimated a1c
the problem with charts like this one is this   "conversion: hba1c = (46.7 +plasma glucose) / 28.7 plasma glucose = (28.7 * hba1c) - 46.7"   it's very hard to accurately work something like this out with an equation in general but especially as the numbers that are only loosely related
thank you wanishi wado looking at it looks right, i remember when i had my 1st a1c and it was off the chart and my bg was above 500
my a1c was 7.6 not to high but concerned enough that the doctor told me to change my eating habits
steve looks accurate to me i would trust it rachel, the previous poster was right in indicating the chart represents an average, so an a1c of 8 represents an average sugar of 183 over 3 months
what's more as the a1c goes down the post meals make up more of the a1c number
so at an a1c over 10 over 70% of that number depends on your fasting blood sugar, but at an a1c of 7, the post meal reading becomes a more important component
my most recent a1c was 5.5, which according to the chart my blood glucose is 111
my a1c's are between 6.3 and 7.4, i don't exercise on a daily basis, just every so often, and work a physical job in a warehouse
my a1c before was 7.0 and now my a1c is 5.7
:) i have now been on the pump for just over 1 month and my a1c has gone from 8.2 to 6.6
yes that would be very good #s i run 83 and 130 and new a1c was 5.9 weeeeeeeeeeee www
i started using (myfitnesspal) in april of 2012, since then i have lost 54 pounds, dropped bp meds and have an a1c of 5.5
a1c was 6.7 down from 7.7
my last a1c was also 6.7
my a1c is 6.3 so i am presuming my sugars are under control
appointment today didn't go well sugars still high and a1c was still 8.6 so i have been put on lantus
no its a slow acting basal insulin, my a1c dropped in 10 days rom 14.9 to 10
had a1c running high 6's last one was a 7
i would never have brought my a1c down to 5.8% eating like that
they also give guidlines to keep your a1c below 7.0&hellip;this equates to something like a bs of 170 average
about 4 months ago when my a1c went from 5.6 to 5.8, without changing my diet in any way, i decieded to try it
i only know what shows up on my bloodwork related to a1c is under 5.6 does not suggest diabetes, prediabetes or risk of it
last year my a1c was 7.5 and a couple of weeks back when it was checked it was 6.0
people on dc have reported they tested their a1c with their dr and then for some reason or other did a home a1c test,  they reported their results were within a couple of points of one another
tml english hi everyone i just had great news my a1c went up but not much, i mean i thought it would be 9 or 10 way my sugar was
f your a1c is high &gt; 10+, take some time off work( 3 mos)and hit the gym 1-2  hrs / day  6 days / wk
ring the a1c&lt; 6  then scale back  from the gym
i keep my blood glucose (bg) levels at or near the normal range, my last a1c is 5.5, and i have lost something like 50 lbs since feb 2011
at the clinic the other day they did a new, or at least new to them, test that is similar to the a1c but uses a smaller time frame, 3 weeks instead of 3 months
my a1c was over 13%
right now im taking 75/25 humalog mix and its so easy that i feel like i dont have to do anything even though i do&hellip; hopefully tommorow my a1c will be down and they will actually talk to me about it&hellip;my doctors are such butts katie , i heard in one in your prior comments that u soooooo wanted a pump &hellip; well my last a1c was 13 point something
if dr did the a1c test (average of your bg readings over 90 days) and it was above 6 that may do it too
after all this is done then i will see the surgeon then they want a physical, lab work ( with a1c test at 7.0 or lower) a clearance from my cardiologist
anyway my a1c was at a 13
i'm losing weight and my a1c is at 6.5 i'm on a new insulin called victoza and it's helping
i was taking 1 pill twice a day but small changes in my diet, helped to lower my a1c and bgl enough that my doctor lowered the dose to 1 a day
i started with metformin, 3months later added starlix, a1c stayed in the 6.2  range for years, but had to go off the metformin due to kidney problems, when starlix would not do it alone my doctor dropped the starlix and put me on lantus solostar pen once a day, after he added apidra pen with my largest meal, now working with a cde and am taking 40 units lantus twice a day with 10 units apidra twice a day ,still tweaking doses but coming back to line, gone from 12.4 to 8.4 in a little over 4month wish i would have been put on insulin when first diagnosed
i went from a 11.1 a1c to 6.1&hellip;yep it's working :p i take glipizide 2.5 mg  before breakfast and 2.5mg at supper time
while in the hospital  last january they told me my a1c, i think it was around 8.6
i was lucky, everything i did worked in helping me get my a1c from 14.1 to 5.9 in a short amount of time
tml english a year ago my a1c was 6.7
i don't want to seem unfriendly, but to me it seems that your screen name may say it clearly "d[iabetes] denier"   to have an a1c of 13.3 there must have been a lot of eating of simple carbohydrates and/or starchy foods
i find it a bit unusual that your doctor would go so long in between a1c tests given that your last a1c was over 6.5
i just had my yearly a1c and it was down from 5.8 last year to 5.3 last week when diagnosed in july 2011, my a1c was 12.3
my a1c was 7.9, the lowest it's been in 18 years
my a1c is 8.0
my a1c is 5.9 i was recently diagnosed at pre-diabetic
i was, and my first a1c was 5.7 numbers were too high on that fasting glucose tolerance test, even got a second opinon
my a1c was 14.3
my last a1c was 29 dec 11 with the result of 8.3, has gone up from 6.8 from jun 11
6.8 my last a1c was in novemer and was 5.9%
last time i check which was in august it was 9.8&hellip;getting there i am now taking glipizide er which helped bring my a1c down from 7.8 to 6.5 with no side effects
my a1c was 11.5 in may 2010
i'm absolutely envious of you guys who's a1c is below a 7
just because my pancreas is on a permanent vacation, and i'm only on metformin, i'll always will be envious of those who's a1c is below a 7
just learned that my a1c has jumped back up to 6.9 from 6.5-ugh
my a1c was 8.5/ or 197 average for the past three months
i maintain my bg at normal levels (as long as i don't stray from my plan) and my last a1c was 5.5, and i lost about 50 lbs in the process
a1c is a shorthand we use for glycated hemoglobin a1c
so now i eat a very low carb/ high protein meal plan and have maintained my bg levels in the "normal range" have an a1c of 5.5, and have lost 65 lbs this past year
a1c is based on the previous 90 days, but the more recent bs's will have more affect on the reading
a1c is based on a 3 to 4 month average of your blood glucose
my a1c is down from 7.2 to 6.4
i too had good results so i understand how happy you are right now :) my 3 month a1c was 5.6 and my dr says im diabetic
with my issue can someone help me pls thanks in late 2009 and all of 2010, my control got worse and my a1c's started climbing into the 7's after years in the 6's
i am working on getting back down to 7.0 from 8.8 now&hellip; i am working on getting my a1c down to 7.0, which is where i am now since 17 april, 012
i typically had an a1c with injections around 6 to 6.5
while on the pump, my a1c dropped to 4.6 to 5
my last a1c was a 4.5-4.7
my a1c was 6.8 in december and has jumped to 7.9 in march
a1c was 6.6 total cholesterol 176 hdl 38 ldl 108  trig 152 i feel good about it
&hellip; my a1c result is 6.0
don't worry too much, the rest of the time will help to balance it a little since the a1c will reflect about 3 months of averages
his a1c went from 10 to a 7.1
&hellip; yeah&hellip;whatever the result, i'll deal with it&hellip; i getting my a1c next week &hellip; doc told me it would likely still be high because i didn't start getting control till late november &hellip; he said i might have an a1c of maybe 11 something
my a1c is 5.6 and that is what it was when i was diagnosed, then i lost 30 lbs,and it is still at that same number
blood glucose tests between 80-180 will result in an a1c in the 6's
my a1c was 8 it is so frustrating
i had been able to have an a1c of 5.5%, (currently 6.1%) maintain my bg levels at 80 to 130 mg/dl, lose 65# of fat within 5 mo and keep it off for these past 3+ yrs
my fasting bg was 79 and my a1c was 5.3
tml english hi dc my fasting bg has been between 77-99 for the month of february, 2month ago a1c was 6.3 do you think it's lower now
doc says nothing but if a1c goes higher she have to put me on meds for every person who has a great a1c i imagine there are many who don&#39;t and just don&#39;t share
so you read here those who have great a1c&#39;s and applaud them because they worked hard to get there
i had my a1c under 6.0 and my blood sugar control was the best i had ever seen
my a1c's remained below 6.0
i had an a1c of 5.6 before pumping
the numbers for the first month of the three month period covered by the a1c are not so influential in the a1c result, the numbers during the second month have a greater influence but it is the numbers during the third month that have by far the greatest influence on the a1c result
my numbers were very good for the last 6 weeks of the period covered by my a1c test and that overshadowed the bad numbers preceeding that 6 week period
tml english i just been diagnosed pre-diabetic  my a1c is 6.2, i can not get in touch with my dr now and i am waiting for him to tell me if i am going on metformin
first of all 6.2 a1c is a good number, mine is 6.3-having worked backwards from 13.1, so yeah i do know about bad numbers
i managed to lose about 100lbs simply by changing my diet and lowering my a1c to 6.5
just an update a little over 5 months ago my latest a1c was 5.5 that was 2 years since diagnosis
a1c 5.4, september 2012 nice work
my latest a1c a couple weeks ago was 5.5 so i went up a couple points but still in very good control
that' my goal, to get my a1c down from 8.1 to less than 7 and below
just to update it 6 months later my a1c was 5.2 and 6 months after that (a couple weeks ago) it was 5.1
my latest a1c a couple weeks ago was 5.5 so i went up a couple points but still in very good control
congratulations&hellip;on your a1c&hellip;results&hellip;awesome job have a blessed weekend&hellip;and do the happy dance&hellip;   onbefunblonde57 how did you manage it
i've gotten onto metformin, changed my diet and have lost the weight, which is great, and my a1c is back to 5.4
tml english currently my a1c level went up to an 8
however my a1c had gone down, so doc did arthrisis tests and d, and b12 and even did xrays on my foot, which does have slight arthritis because of an old injury, but the rest was negative except for the vitamins
and he gave me antibiotics and told me  to rest the foot, so i did and now after a week or so my finger is doing ok and is back to its normal color and doesnt hurt anynmore, i even started going to the gym again and my a1c is down from 11.9 to 7.5 yey
through changes in diet, exercise, always taking my meds and communicating with my doctor my bg usually stays between 80 and 120 and my a1c is 5.3%
i am still working at getting my a1c down to 5.00
dramatically a1c since i started on the pump in august was 11.1 and now 7.5
like you i lost a lot of weight, ate a good diet got my a1c's down to 5 or less and i feel better than ever
last year developed back problems again and blood work came back showing a1c of 9.3
a1c is now 7.5 and have learned a lot about managing my sugar
when i was diagnosed, i weighed 346, mya1c was 7.2 and i was severely depressed
now i weigh 200, my a1c is 5.6% and i am able to handle whatever life throws at me
after taking diabetes classes, &amp; being scared (my family has diabetes, dad died from kidney failure, my brothers both almost lost their feet) so when i got it,  i went blurry,  it was very hard to drive, my sugar was 550 &amp;  my a1c was 10
i immediately made changes big time for me with exercising ea day -walking 5 miles- losing 73lbs in 18 months, a1c6, feel so much more energy, endurance for exercise, never did before, always thought i was too busy, but now i am a priority to take care of me
i went from an a1c of 10.5- 6.2 in 4 months
i have been on 500 mg metformin, 1 in the am &amp; 2 in the pm for over three months now with no problems and a a1c of 6.2
tml english hi everyone i went to my follow up diabetes class today and the test from the lab has come back with some proetin in my pee but my a1c was 7.1 so the doctor there thinks it might be my bladder that has an infection as my blood pressure was nromal an ideas thanks and my bg was 12.1 so it a little high
when he took glocotika 850mg (metformin hcl) his a1c is 5.9, but that made him suffered hypoglichemia
when my dad at the hospital same days ago, i asked his doctor before discharged him, if we better use insulin than oral med, but his doc said no :( cause according to him my dad's a1c is 5.9
i have much better control now and my a1c's are back in the 6's
well i got the results back from my blood work and my fasting glucose was 299 and my a1c was 9
i just did the lab work this morning for my a1c after a 12 hour fast
i hope no one thinks i am bragging, but i went to my doctor appointment today, and he was quite pleased that my a1c on my last test a week ago was 5.8
hey, this is great a1c 5.8&hellip;you should be very proud of yourself
we got a good handle on my bg and my recent a1c was 6.4
my gp is running an a1c but i've done the accucheck thing and my levels are all above 100 and the highest has been 175
i take it in a tea form [and yes, i sweeten with a little brown sugar], and my hba1c came down to 4.8
went from a1c-7 to 6
last a1c was 5.8
i strive for an a1c of 6.0
for the past 5 years i've had my a1c readings at a 5 or lower i won't lose control of that again
this is the first big test i've had done,i've only been to a regular doctor,he then refered me to a neroligist,ive been only a diabetic for four years,my bs has never been higher then 500 an my a1c was only 9 or 10 its 6.8 now,but the neroligist says it doesnt matter what your bs run or how long you've been a diabetic some get perifreal nerophy an some with really bad diabetis dont,they dont no what causes it or how to treat it,all i no is half the medicine they give i cant take cause im bipolar an makes me sucidal
my last a1c was 11.3 and up until this month i've only been on metformin
as i have mentioned my neuropathy became bad long after my a1c went under 6.0 so the better control theory does not work for me
i was hoping to avoid it by getting and keeping my a1c below 6
y a1c's are 9.5&hellip;god knows i try to eat right&hellip;i know i should get to the gym, but i hurt and have no ambition
tell your doc what your going thrue as well as how hard a time you having with your meds they will send you to an educator that will help you use your meds better  i was dx 5 years ago and just got my a1c back 5.9 it has been a fight and then some but i got it now as well as the pump please get so help my frend  if there is anything i can do to help please let me know  best wishes  harlen your situation is heart-breaking, but i'm not sure anyone here has the wrecklessness to tell you how to do your insulin, as it is a highly individualized thing
is starting a1c was &gt;14 and his bg was 445
my starting a1c was 9.5 and bg was 382
my a1c at the doctor was 6.1 with an average bg of 122
his a1c was 6.9 with an average bg of 151
i am hoping to see similar improvement, although at an a1c of 16, i think anything would be an improvement
i was diagnosed in july with a1c &gt;12 and by october it was at 5.1
a1c went from 8.0 to 5.0 in 3 months following a a very strict low carb diet
not sure i am able to piece the situation together from the various posts&mdash;are you saying that you consistently get high blood sugar readings after meals, but your a1c is around 4.5
there are two possible causes for this situation that i can think of:  first, you are getting a higher reading then what your actual blood sugar is (this could occur if you draw blood from a site contaminated with sugars); second, your a1c is lower then your true blood sugar&mdash;i know i personally take quite a bit of alpha lipoic acid (with biotin added) which does cause the a1c to be lower then without taking it
when i got my first diagnosis my a1c was 6.5
my last a1c last monday was 5.9
er a1c at the beginning was 14 then 3 weeks later she dropped to 10
think right now her a1c is between 7-8
my last a1c was 5.6
so far i have no complications, my a1c is 5.7, but my creatinine is increasing
hi there restless i used to be in your shoes have been t2 for 2 yrs my a1c was 13 and admitted to hospital many many times my t2 has been very aggressive and damaging to my body in last 2 yrs have spent a total of seven months in hospital and of that 3 weeks in icu bg 1100 was taking 6 shots a day between 200 and 300 units of humolog and 300 units lantus daily still had numbers in the 300's even hospital had very hard time getting numbers down well after my fourth surgery for t2 complications my endo said lets try the pump so it took about two weeks to get the settings dialed in and insulin steadily being delivered to my body till numbers started coming down now they stay right around 100-150 even two hours after eating and im down to using 150 units of insulin every three days my body didnt like the ups and downs of shots as they need to be a routine and given close to same time everyday i work hard long hours and was hard for me to do that 100% now pump does it plus i saved allot of money on pharmacy co pays for meds and needles now ive been on pump a little over a month just had two surgery in that time to fix t2 problems that came up i need 1 last surgery in june and should be done i feel 1000% better more energy happier and mood swings have disapeared since bg levels are closer to normal and with pump i havent found anything i cant do ive posted my story on here many times all i can say and people who read my responces and posts and my wife can tell you without the pump i would probably be dead my t2 has been horrific the pump has saved my life and my team from dr
my starting a1c was 8.8, and i was able to get that down to 6.1 at one point
but now my a1c has risen up to 7.4 and my daily fasting blood sugar levels are now averaging about 185 on my meter&hellip;doing the exact same things
i've been told to get my levels down below 130 and an a1c below 6.0
my a1c is also currently 7.4
i didn't try to go from my high a1c number to a lower a1c number at one time, i did it in quarters which didn't create stress or frustration
i also was able to stop the use of the twice daily nph insulin injections while keeping my bg (blood glucose) levels in the vicinity of 80 to 130 mg/dl and achieved an a1c of 5.5% and eventually lost 65lbs over the course of 5 mo
when i was first diagnosed my sugar was 892 and my a1c was 17, off the charts
tml english think low a1c thoughts, think low a1c thoughts
my a1c went from 8.7 to 7.1
my numbers are relatively low, early pre-diabetic, a1c 5.9%, fpg 105, ogtt 156
the apps have helped me drop my a1c from 8.6 in january to 6.4 in june
i had tests run (fasting and a1c 160 and 7.8) he told me i was pre-diabetic and needed to lose weight
by my next appointment, he had left the firm and i was seeing another "new" doctor, she took my a1c, fasting reading, and weight (7.8, 170, 262) gave me a prescription for metformin and a whole bunch of reading material and diet plan
about two months ago my a1c was 9.5 &mdash; this was after a good 8 months of taking supplements
i thought that if i were to get my a1c below 6 i wouldn't be but the doc said once a diabetic always a diabetic
i achieved an a1c of 5.5 and lost 65 lbs over a 5 mo period and had normalized my blood glucose (bg) levels
one may achieve an a1c of 4.4 to 5.4 and have one's bg levels in the normal range, but that does not mean one no longer has diabetes
a1c tests only gives you an average measure of what your bg levels have been the past 90 days
he is doing awesome with an a1c of 6
we know this will change, but for now, he is responding well with an a1c of 6
my a1c is 6.9, was 5.9&hellip;any suggestions
my a1c's had gone from low 6's to 7.5
i limit myself to 120 grams of carb per day and my last a1c was 6.7
i feel great a1c was down from 10 to 8
tml english honestly being a young diabetic is difficult especially at parties my a1c is of good rating&hellip;but its not my goal whic is 6-9,   what can i do to make it fun as a teen
my a1c averages 6.2 to 6.5 every 3 months
my a1c has been stuck on very low&mdash;-only 5.9, for 3 and a half years now, i feel like crap, and my numbers are extremely brittle at 5.9
i am a type 1, my a1c is 4.8
bernsteins a1c, as a type 1 for over 70 years, is 4.5
for every .5 a1c increase over 5&hellip;you risk of heart disease doubles
at 5.9 a1c, your average blood sugar is 123
my range at an a1c of 5.9 has been very very very abnormal&hellip;yeah, 123 is a good average, but, my range is between 86 and 600 everyday
i run 80 to 130  all the time unless i do something to make it not and i do from time to time lol or when i am sick  best wishes harlen so far my fasting #80-110 after meals          #90-125 beforebedtime     #80-100 a1c 6.1 when i feel i am dropping lower, i test and take care of
i was told i needed my a1c to be between 5-6.5
after a recent hospital stay, in may, i found out my a1c wad 17
i started seeing a new endocrinologist at the beginning of the month and i'm happy to say my a1c is now 8.6
my a1c was 7.3 yesterday and i've lost 10 pounds
her a1c was always above 12, and now that she wants to have children and is working on bringing it down she is putting on a little weight, but it makes me so happy to see her looking healthy
my last a1c was 6.8
my a1c went down from an 8 to a 6 fast
praying god's best to you and yours   james baker oh forgot yo tell you all i went from a1c of 12.7 currently 7.1 fantastic
i did just get my lab results back and my abc's are outstanding (a1c 5.9, bp averages 117/78 and my ldl is 61)
before meals 70-100 2 hrs after meal 100-140 a1c &lt;7 which means blood sugar range of 140 or less but no lower than 70 my bs was 123 last night 2 hrs after i ate and this morning was 98
this new doc wants my a1c to be under 6
my a1c is almost a 12 and i go to the endocrinologist this week
i had an a1c of 14
when i was diagnosed, my blood glucose level was 670 and my a1c was over 20&hellip; i had to change my entire life&hellip; my last a1c was 6.9&hellip; it just requires lots of hard work&hellip; when i got sick last april i was diagnosed glucose 804 i felt as if i was dying now almost a year later i have lowered my a1c to 4.0 and my insulin was cute in half i'm type 2 a long way to go to lose more weight but now i'm eating healthier how did you manage a 4.0 a1c
no offense to you at all, but oh, my god&hellip;an a1c of over 20
but because i was eating a typical american meal plan i was having ok bg levels and would have an a1c in the 7 % range
my bg levels hover around 80 to 130 mg/dl, i achieved an a1c of 5.5% (currently 6.1%) i lost 65 lbs over a 5 mo period
it eventually did and the doctor said that my a1c was 15.8
i should come up with an mlm "miracle diabetes health" scheme &hellip; i have gone from 325 pounds and an a1c of 10.0, high cholesterol and blood pressure to 160 pounds an a1c of 5.8 "ideal" cholesterol and blood pressure
i have developed a low carb high protein meal plan which lowers one's insulin resistance, manage my blood glucose (bg) numbers closer to the normal range, keep my a1c at the mid 5's and lower my weight all for only the cost of what i eat
my a1c was around 15 and i could see myself headed for an early grave
within 6 months, my a1c was 7.5 and a bg below 100 or above 200 was extremely rare
i've had one a1c test in almost 2 years
tml english tomorrow i get my labs done 6 months ago my a1c was 5.7 i did recently increase my daily carb "allowance" from 50 to 75 grams so of course i am curious as to how this may effect the a1c
in that i increased my carb intake i tried to test much more often this past 3-4 weeks (and had saved up a few 'extra' test strips) here's what i got: 7 day 21 tests - 97 mg/dl 14 day 34 tests - 101 30 day 74 tests - 110 understanding that the a1c test is an estimate based on the last three months strongly weighted towards the last 21-30 days &hellip; what do you think
for 4 years my blood glucose averaged 88 and my a1c 4.8
this last few months my blood glucose averaged  98 and my a1c was 5.3
i am happy with my diabetes control and honestly it is the absolute least of my heath concerns &hellip; an a1c of 5.3 is awesome
well, an average bg of 110 translates as an a1c right around 5.5 - be interested to know your results
2 months ago my a1c was 8.7, today it was 7.1
i wish my a1c was as good, my last one went from 8.1 to 8.5
i'm a tryin' ;) my last a1c was 3 months ago and came back at 5.7
and then on top of that, your a1c drops almost 2 points
the number i was really wandering about was my a1c, she was not happy with me 2months ago because it had gone from 8.4 to 8.7 after she put me on glucophage
tml english i just was operated  for open heart surgery and my blood work came back with  a blood level of 90 and my a1c wqas 5.7
i would like some input on this issue my a1c is 5.7 and my doctor is on my case all the time
my first a1c number after being diagnosed over 4 years ago, was 5.7, sorry to say
actually jz, i think 5.7 is far better of an a1c to a 6.7, 7.7 or above
a1c for non diabetes persons is usually somewhere between the low 4's to 5.5
in september my a1c was 5.2 and my bad cholesterol at 198
i have filled out about 20 pages of forms and my doctor has prepared a list of my a1c's 1980-2009
first a1c was 9.8 on october 6th
went back to the doctor last week and he did another a1c and i'm down to 7.2
tml english i saw my endo a couple of fridays ago and we discussed my a1c's, which are always below 6.0 and this most recent one was 5.0
he also said, aim for an a1c less than 8 instead of 7 (my goal)
control can be an elusive balance for we t1s&hellip; i was diagnosed type 2 in june 2011,im on metformin 500 mg a day my a1c was 10.8 now it has stayed at 5.8 since i have lost 45 pounds since diagnosed im on a low carb diet and hoping to be off medicine in another 6 months,metformin has made me less hungry for sure i wish you the best:) thanks so much for the best wishes
good on the a1c at 4.9
you've got to change your a1c target to 6's
when i met with my endo and state that i wanted to get my a1c below 6.0 i am at 6.6 now dr
my a1c's have been below 6.0 for almost 10 years
i would be happy to score a higher a1c and as we all know, the a1c is merely a picture of the average blood sugar over the last 2-3 months, not an accurate account of how well in control a person actually is
tml english went to the  foot doctor i had to but some stuff 40.00 but it it doesn't work has money back garantee (sp) he told me i was to young to take the 2 toenails  off permantly  to try this stuff if it doesn't work i can get my money back will see  he did ask about my a1c # and said fasting # should be below 120 my are most of the time so i am doing ok he did tell me about a lady he just seen that he was going take her toe off and he warned me watching my feet  he told me it toes were red to get them checked out even if they didn't hurt so please everybody check your feet i dont want to lose you
so, i had some fasting bloodwork done and my a1c was at 7.2
all a1c's since the first have remained below 6
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
my a1c dropped from 7.4 to 6 after i lost 45 pounds
you can do a mail in a1c that you buy at wal-mart for 9.00 and the meijer pharmacy does a clinic monthly where you can get an a1c a lipid profile or a liver enzyme test for 25.00   on those now rare occassions when my sugar jumps up to a higher number i'll drink a glass of water with a tablespoon or two of apple cider vinegar and it has a pretty quick effect for me
an older friend, pr sorry your not doing well  a1c are done every 3 months or the ins will not pay for it
my august a1c was 6.6
his dr said he would allow me to diet &amp; exercise as long as my a1c stayed below 7, so i was good for 5 yrs, then i lost my mother, same time i went through a divorce, i went to see him and it was 8.1, i told him the stress i had been under, he said it didnt matter and put me on metformin, i took it for a few weeks, it made me sick to my stomach, i also failed to mention i test 3 times a day, i stopped taking the medicine and worked on stress relief as well as coming to grips with the loss of my mother, went back to him and my a1c was back at 7 although i had not taken the medicine but i didnt tell him i had stopped, now my blood sugars when i awake are never above 110, through out the day never above 140, at times if i dont eat regular say within 4 hrs it goes below 80, around 70 and i feel bad so i eat, my question is can diet and exercise reverse diabetes
my body made a change this year and my a1c jumped to 8
so i think things can be controled with diet and exercise but still have your a1c checked at least every 6 months, 3 is better
last a1c was 6.1 from 8.5
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
a1c is in the 6.3 neighborhood
my last a1c was over 9 so i was switched to these medications
my a1c is 8+ as well&hellip; due to my lung disease, osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia, i find it hard to engage in much excercise
my first a1c was six weeks ago and it was 11.2
my a1c this morning was 7.5
my a1c is 5.6, but it has been under six since prior to starting victoza&mdash;for me, the benefit has been steadier rather than lower numbers, which works for me since i like to maintain very tight control
my a1c is going to be 7.9 next time if this keeps up
this all is moving in the right direction but my a1c was 8.3 i was so disappointed in that
thank you this is what i did and my a1c went from 14.1 to 5.9 in 4 months and has remained below 6.0 ever since
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
my a1c was 11.4, cholesterol was 272, blood sugar was 250, but  my weight was 215 lbs
after 6 months of diet and one hour of exercise a day 7 days a week plus meds, my weight dropped to 155lbs i'm a 5'8" male, which gives me a bmi of 23, healthy weight,  my blood sugar daily is about 94, my cholesterol is 131, my a1c is 5.7 and my triglycerides went form 1094 to 61
you are doing well, but the a1c is based around the lifespan of your red blood cells which is about 90-120 days so in order to see the "real" drop in a1c you need to wait 3-4 months
the a1c is still high, but if you are having numbers like 113 after you eat, there are spikes somewhere else that you might need to be aware of
my a1c level is 9.2
tml english think low a1c thoughts, think low a1c thoughts
my hgb a1c went from 10.9 to 8.3 in a few months and my total cholesterol went from 222 to 148
my a1c has been 12 for the past few years and i'm literally sick of trying to get it to come down because it hasn't worked in the last few years that i've tried
just this past year i met an incredible doctor that helped me to bring my a1c down to 8 so that i can get a pump and then out of nowhere our insurance provider told us that it would cost us $4,000 for a pump and a cgm
you're on shots what do you expect an a1c of 7 lol
well, how about 90 pounds lost in less than 7 months, a1c from 13.2 to 4.7 and fasting bg from 388 to 96
the question i have is if you get your a1c below 6 say mid 5s are you still considered a diabetic
the 7.7 you are talking about is the a1c results which would ideally be under 7.0 so you are not completely off the charts
i'm still exercising like a fiend, and my last a1c was 5.8
tml english what is a1c mine is 6.8 blood sugar is never over 120 what can i do to get my a1c down the a1c test is actually an average of blood sugars over a three month period
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
tml english i was diagnois w ith type 2 at end of august my a1c was 6.75 then in jan it went to a 6.9 and my dr
since then i have not been able to lose weight, my a1c is now 7.3, my body hurts most all the time
i ask because i was diagnosed type 2 by my primary with an a1c of 10.2 and did oral meds with little to no change and lots of side effects
now on a pump and my a1c is 8.1 in less than a year
my glucose was 255, a1c 9.9
my goal for next years exam is to be 20 lbs less (i know i can loose 1.5 lbs a month) and my a1c to be 6.5-6.7
three months ago i went to the doctor and my a1c was 9.3
the other day i went back and my a1c had dropped to 7.9
my a1c was high like yours and is now down in the 6.5 range which is close to what yur md probably wants for you
recent a1c @ 8.3
my fbs at the time was 148 and my a1c was 7.2
i was able to loose weight and after about 5 years not only my a1c was in the 6.0 range but, i had lost about 50 lbs
my a1c is now running in the neighborhood of 5.2 to 5.6 for the past 5 years
my fbs at the time was 148 and my a1c was 7.2
i was able to loose weight and after about 5 years not only my a1c was in the 6.0 range but, i had lost about 50 lbs
my a1c is now running in the neighborhood of 5.2 to 5.6 for the past 5 years
a1c's have been around 5.4 to 5.9  alan august 17, 2011, it seems like a lifetime ago
i broke my wrist and when i was at er they told me my bg's were 250 my a1c i think was around 11 last reading was 5.4 and my bp was 200 over 100
a1c two years ago was 5.8
successive a1c readings were 9.7 &amp; 8.5&hellip;  i'm either eating like i'm supposed to or binging on everything in sight
for the most part, i've been able to maintain my a1c's in the 6's as a result of cutting back on the carbs
we caught my diabetes at an a1c of 6.4, i've been on byetta, victoza, and now am on bydureon
i ended up in the hospital w/ a blood sugar of 1016 and a a1c of 16
6 weeks after diagnosis w/ a strict diet and exercise i was able to bring my a1c down to 5.6 and was able to get off insulin
last bg was 100; last a1c 6.0
my blood sugar was running around 377 and my a1c was 14
my a1c was 7.1 in october, 5.6 in january, and 5.4 in april
i worked hard to get my numbers down and after having an a1c of bellow 10, 3 times i was able to get a pump
after having an a1c so high it was litterally off the charts to now having a very good a1c of about 7.2
am now five years cancer free, have lost a little weight and my a1c was 6.6 down from 7,so i feel like i am sitting on top of the world
going back in two weeks and planning to show him up cuz i'm expecting good test results&hellip; from a1c of 15+, to somewhere around 6 in four months&hellip;stick that in your pipe and smoke it buddy
there was a big heaping serving of inyoface (to the dr and diabetes) when my 2nd a1c showed i dropped to a 6 after 4 months and my 2 test since then - one being this week - has me at 5.2
10 weeks ago my a1c was 5.5 and now it's 6.3
an a1c is not really a good indicator of control when pregnant because it's very important for your blood sugar to not go very high, i've heard over 140 but really i don't know so you will have to talk to your doctor
going for blood work next monday and hoping/expecting my a1c will improve from the last 6.9 but&hellip;
i have had a1c&#39;s as low as 6.4, but no lower
but of course cortisone made my bs go up and my a1c go to 7.4
the doc says my a1c is at 6.5
a 6.5 a1c reading is pretty good and the normal average is 70-120 so you are still in the good range
i have pretty much followed this and have lost weight and my a1c's have been a 5 for over 7 years
i had plans to loose weight and just thought of a medical check up before my weight loss programme and i found out i was diabetic with hga1c of 13 with fbs over 355
if not, 64 mg/dl is a lower than normal bg (blood glucose) and does not equate to a 6.4 hba1c which is a average of your bg over 2 or 3 months  to get a 2 hour post-prandial (after eating) comparison, you should also check to see what your bg was before you ate
(i had a fasting blood sugar of 74 on 8/11 when my blood was drawn and my hba1c from the same blood draw came back at 6.6
to be clear your last hba1c test came back at 6.4
my a1c was 6.5 for the first time in over a year so i am satisfied
a1c needs to be in the 6's
my a1c is 6.7
i just wanted to get away from my first a1c which was 9.1 i thought i would come down a point or two but nothing like this
my last a1c was 9.6
ever since my a1c mark after 3 months, i haven't been back to hospital
and pastas and rice&hellip;all of the foods i have mentioned are much more nutrient dense and better for you&hellip;and keep a close eye on your bg&hellip;do it for one week&hellip;watch how your body responds&hellip;then decide for yourself how you want to eat&hellip;i did the recommended diet for a solid month after diagnosis&hellip;couldn't get my bg in check&hellip;i ate the whole grains at every meal&hellip;because i was "suppose to"&hellip;fast forward nine mos&hellip;my a1c is 5.0 and i am no longer on meds&hellip;you will find that most people here on dc
my a1c is 5.5, (well within "normal" range) and i manage my bg levels by my eating plan alone, without diabetes meds
an no wonder&hellip;my a1c was over 11
my #'s are really good (last a1c was 6.4), but the weight just keeps creeping on
just got done seeing the old pratice but new doctor and he want me to loss 2# till im at 175# &amp; walk 30 mins 5x per week start with there dietician and redo a1c in 3 mths does what you said mean that you will not be taking the gylycesset, or do you mean you are supposed to take the new drug plus do these things
my a1c was 7
i recently was called into my doctors office after blood work when my a1c shot up to 12
tml english my a1c is 103 has anyone else experianced such a high reading
i used to feel so weak and had no energy but since ive changed my bad habits im feeling much better no your a1c is not 103 mine is 10.4
lowest mine ever was 10.2 highest was 14.9 last a1c test was 11.9
my last ha1c was 6.0
i was in the er yesterday and was told my a1c is 9.9 my blood glucose reading was 348
remember, the a1c is just an informational test, the actual stuff the a1c tests for doesn't actually cause any health problems as far as i know
my a1c tests are 6 months apart now that i have good control, so i'm thinking i'm okay to give the first 3 or 4 months
follow your doctors instructions while educating yourself&hellip;because high bg levels are dangerous&hellip;and bringing them down is important&hellip;but waste no time in getting on the ball with all the research that proves the way we treat diabetes is what makes it a progressive disease&hellip;please see my lastest post&hellip;the aetiology of obesity&hellip;i know of what i speak&hellip;i follow these protocols&hellip;and my a1c is 4.7&hellip;i do not know what my a1c was at diagnosis
my bgl averages between 115-125 and the last a1c was 5.7 so i have to believe that this has been helpful
tml english my last a1c was 13 point something &hellip;  yes my #'s were high &amp; out of control
my #'s now suggest an a1c of 7 point something &hellip; a drop of 6 points if i keep it up &hellip; so happy to have my pump &hellip; thank you medtronic
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
y bs was over 350 and a1c was over 13
my a1c is 6.3
my a1c was 7.8
my last a1c was 5.7 my cholesterol and trigs jumped a bit but its all trial and error, i'll be as flexibile as i can, make some adjustments and see what happens for the next round
i eat all these fruits and just bolus and have a 6.4 a1c  used to be 8 though before my pump
kidney function normal, a1c of 6.3 with no meds
i went from a 13.2 a1c to a 4.7 a1c in less than six months, which is a heck of a turnaround&hellip;so is it possible that if this is kept up long enough the damage could be reversed
my a1c has decreased from 10.0 to 5.7 while consuming aspartame multiple times daily &hellip; but then i am not a mouse   steve nor do you consume the copious amounts they feed those poor little guys
tml english i started out in 2007 with an a1c of 8.5 and was taking up to 5 - 500mg metformin per day
thanks for your reply, this was like switching on a light my a1c last april was 7.0 and last month was 18.5
at times they have been up around 250, my a1c is around 6.5
i am 66, diabetes is under good control (a1c 5.5), and though i take many meds, all labs are in good order
i was diagnosed in mid-december with t2 (a1c 9.0), high blood pressure, heightened cholesterol
i have no symptoms, (yet), but my a1c is about 7
my a1c levels were under 6 for years and now i'm at 6.4, down from 6.6  3 months ago
i have been the same with high numbers that it seems my a1c has gone from 10.3 to11.9,they just put me on insulin and i'm trying to work out more,just walking,i'm going to get more water in my system, and read all the food label that has helped with my sugar intake and now i have started writing things down in my book so i can see what i have done day to day and that has helped me,my number's has always been 389or more so bad my eyes would hurt,in the past 2 weeks of change they have been 180or less and that makes me feel better if it goes up i drink lots of water to bring it back down
and during some of those times she had an a1c of 6.0
after all, an a1c is merely a 24/7 average of one's bg levels for 90 days (weighted more heavily on the past 2 wks)
10253-went-to-dr-today---a1c-5-7
wow i wouldnt know how to act if i could get my a1c down to5.7 my last a1c was 9.8 lowest ive had in forever so congratulations to you do you or anyone else have any suggestions to help bring mine down anymore thanks what seems to work the best is learning about what i can eat and what i shouldn't eat
my last a1c was 7.8 up from 7.3
wish i haf a1c 5.7
said it was a good a1c, anything below a 6 was ok
hugs i am 69 yrs old, type ii since 1989, current weight 146(216 when diagnosed), fasting bs 110, a1c 6.8 (in jan
my last a1c level i was able to get what i considered to be a great accomplishment of 5.8
my a1c is 5.0, 16 in a row between 4.9 and 5.4
my last a1c did drop from 8.5 to 7.5, but of course, my dr
i am looking forward to my next a1c on august 5
my may a1c was 5.5 and i have to date lost about 50 lbs of fat
gary hi blade i have struggled with diabetes for a long time now i am now getting complications toe that hasn't healed over a year neuropathy pain very bad try to watch your diet now so you don't have complications i finally found a dietician who takes my insurance my bs has gone down my toe is starting to heal it is amazing what food combinations do to your bs you should try to see a dietician i tip she taught me was to have a yogurt or 1 cup of skim milk before you go to sleep it helps with your bs during the night good luck feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
i was 100 lbs overweight with blood sugars between 170's to 200, high cholesterol, a1c of 7.9
i was diagnosed in june 2011,went on a low carb my a1c was 10.8 now 5.8 and have lost 40 lbs i started by looking up adkins diet on line good luck i saw something on line stating south beach is better than atkins
whats ur opinion thanks it is tempting to not bother with bg readings daily   esp if i feel well other patients say any figure can be written in a book  but the hba1c is the real guide yes, brendan, the a1c could trip up someone who fudges their daily bg numbers, but that does not mean that we should not test at least 3 times daily
while an a1c every 6 months is ok, the standard deviation is a large part of how complications develop or don't develop
you can have an a1c of 6.0, but you can also have extreme highs and lows the entire time that a1c is only a 6.0
i had several lows and got the shakes real bad one time when i had a " perfect" a1c of 5.9&mdash;&mdash;yet, the doctor i saw then just looked at that number only, said everything was perfect&hellip;it wasn't&hellip;good luck
my blood glucose is consistently in the normal range without using diabetes meds at all,  my most recent a1c was 5.5, and i have lost 50+ lbs in 7 mos
my a1c was 14.5% and i didn't even realize how terrible i felt all the time
now my a1c is 6.9% and i went from a size 13 pants to a size 6
it has eliminated my need for injected insulin, or any other diabetes med, kept my bg (blood glucose) at a "normal" level, achieved an a1c of 5.5, and i also lost 65 lbs over the course of 5 mo, and would have probably lost more had i not introduced more fat into my meals again
then the result for the h1a1c would come back sky high around 14
she did so based on my blood sugar test of 138, with an a1c of 6.1
the webmd guide says:   "target blood sugar levels for diabetes":   fasting (4+ hours)         less than 100   before meal                              70-130   after meal (1-2 hours)    less than 180   before exercise,                            100+ if taking insulin   bedtime                                   100-140   a1c               less than or equal to 7.0%   ** of the few tests i've done:   test #1 (5:10 hours after a meal)          81       (after i'd been lying on the floor at the y for 2 hours, then drove to get the glucometer)   tests #2 - #5 were all done before or after the same meal (dinner), yesterday:   test #2  7 pm:         90      (mildly hungry before meal, but didn't eat for 45 more minutes, so i tested a second time)   test #3   7:45 pm    99       (very hungry, dizzy, losing balance
in my future posts, i may answer one question per post, to break it up a bit:) howdy flutter i hate to disagree with your pcp (even though i disagree with drs all the time) but according to your a1c of 7.0% is definitely diabetes according to the ada
"a1c &gt; 6.5%
the "a1c below 7.0 is normal" was a webmd figure
my a1c is 6.1
i was diagnosed 8 years ago and in 6 months my a1c was 6.1
since that time it has been below that (last a1c was 5.7) i have been what they consider well-controlled type 2 for a long time yet i suffer from a number of complications &hellip; so yes &hellip; it is possible &hellip; even though your blood glucose is not out of control
when i went for my 3 month a1c doctor visit in april&hellip;not only were my overall levels at 6.7, i had even lost 15 lbs
i'm not in denial-i know i have diabetes-my a1c was 6.2 a couple months ago-so not bad, but i really just don't care, and seems like nobody else does either
on 500mg metformin sr to bring stats down, cholesterol coming down but triglycerides rising with a1c1
a1c was under 6 now is 6.5
we talked about different things he ws going to put me on, my a1c came back 7.7 and in aug
my doctor just started me on actos this week (15mg) to reduce my blood sugar level as my last a1c was over 9
tml english went to doctor for recheck  my a1c was 5.4  doctor told me that was normal and that i did good he cut my metformin to 500 in the morning and 500 in the evening so i  am doing  very good on my diet yeah for me  you can do it to good luck every body fantastick
tml english more good news my a1c was down to 8 that's still high but considering it was 11 something last time it is a definite improvement
it amazes me at how high someone elses' a1c can start at and how quickly it can drop&mdash;a lot&mdash;-and   mine just inches up and down, nothing spectacular  my high has never been too high, i just learned that it was in the sixes&mdash;&mdash;and now down to 5.8 or 5.9, doesn't sound bad to me, but my dr was concerned, i think it started at 6.4,  and yet, my daily bs can hit 236, still not high&mdash;-but it seems that there is still a little flaw in my system that definitely does not like peanut brittle and chocolates
pr i was wondering if you have considered add cinnomon in your diet- i did and my sugars stay lower, by far a1c =5.9 and droping that a1c is good, you are doing something right so just keep doing it
my a1c went from 6.5 to 5.7 in that short time too
my lab report showed: cholesterol-126, hdl-60, ldl-52, trig-69, a1c-5.8
when you have lots of lows and highs it equals out to be the perfect a1c so i don't get all worked up or care to much about my a1c
last time my doctor checked my a1c it was over 10 i go in on friday to get it checked again
i continue to be off all diabetes drugs and my a1c was 6.0 only last week
most plans now require you to pay the first dollar for deductible and labs and x-rays are on the list&hellip;so if you need an a1c run i pay $26,  a year ago one was done while i was in the hospital it was $63
on levimir12units 2 x daily and novalog 10 units with meals went to a d educator sometimes my bg would be 350 or higher down to 40  my doses were lowered i followed the diet was told to shoot for 65 grams of carbs each meal when diagnosed my a1c was over17 i have gotten that down to 6.7 at last appt
tml english first time on, in march i went to my doctor and had a1c of 10.5 and bg of 286
23238-a1c-in-3d
my a1c went from 8.2 down to 6.2 (two full points)
i was diagnosed last october with an a1c of 10
after starting insulin, but still fine tuning, my next a1c was 7.5
i had my second a1c check in april and it was at 5.9
here are my #'s for the last 2x tested:   july a1c - 5.7 glucose - 86 oct a1c - 5.3 glucose - 96   the chart readings if i am understanding it some has: a1c 5.7 = glucose 117 a1c 5.3 = glucose 105   nov
my numbers are so changeable, it's ridiculous, so, for example, if my a1c is a 5.9, in my case my highs are in the 300s, 500s, and 600s, and my lows are in the 50s&hellip;in most people i have been told, their highs are in the 150s, 200s, with lows in the 80s&mdash;&mdash;-so, i do not myself care for the a1c, but i do realize it is the standard used
i could not agree more&mdash;&mdash;with my last a1c , in fact all of my a1cs&mdash;&mdash;which ranged anywhere from 8.0 all the way down to 5.3, yes, they told me those were wonderful numbers&mdash;&mdash;i disagreed with them&mdash;why
i'm a very brittle diabetic, and when my a1c is 5.9, that means my highs were in the 500s and my lows were in the 50s &mdash;the a1c has been nothing but a huge huge pain for me
i have two charts and a1c 5.7 on one chart it has 117 and on the other it has 111
i do not advise anyone stop seeing a doctor by the way&hellip;this is just me:  one time my a1c was 5.7, but my random blood sugar was 400&mdash;-they said " oh, an a1c of 5.7&mdash;-you are not even diabetic&hellip;there is nothing wrong with you
a1c 5.7 = glucose 117 a1c 5.3 = glucose 105 i think you will find that if your bg 3 month average's are 117 your a1c is 5.7 and so on
3 months ago my a1c was 5.9, and it said that meant my averages were 126
yes&hellip;i had internal bleeding off and on, and it lowered my a1c for sure&hellip;so, a nurse would look at my # and presume i had full control &hellip;she didn't know any different &hellip;understandable, but, then i explained to her i had internal bleeding&hellip;i lost 2 pints of blood from a bleeding ulcer in 2005, and she deliberately ignored me then
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
when my second a1c came back an 8&hellip; she said, " look, you either take this seriously or you will die from complications of diabetes&hellip;" on jan 25, 2011, i totally changed my eating and started exercising
i lost 20lbs&hellip; a1c went to 5.8 and my liver lipids are in range
it was the best thing that could of happened to me, my a1c is a 6, i could now just take metformin pills but i figure if i am doing so good w/ insulin why get off
my a1c is and has been around 6.5 for three years and not on any meds for it
he got labs and this a1c is 11
i have been suffering from major depression since my a1c went from 11.3 all the way to a 16
i'm a vegan, i eat no carbs, no fruit, nothing "illegal", but not only is my a1c extremely high, my bs when i wake up is over 600
if your a1c is 16, then your blood sugars are not just hitting peaks but are high overall
my highest a1c was 11.2 and i know how panicked i was to get it back down as fast as possible since it's not suppposed to be over 6-6.5 per my doctor, and he made sure i understood that i could be doing real damage to my internal organs
an a1c level test is a 3 month average so the initial diagnosis of diabetes really isn't the best time to give an average of glucose levels
a hemoglobin a1c measures your bg over a 3 month period of time; in a percentage
a1c 2/14 was 16.9
my a1c on 9/4 was 10.4 trig 1067, first time ive sern numbers under 200 in 2 years
my a1c was 9.6 and the doc said i was killing my self
my a1c has been above 9 for over a year
ilearned how to find my average blood sugar  on my breeze meter  i have more to learn  i would like to know if my average will match what my next a1c  will show, if it is acurate it will be very usefull to me as i do not have a home a1c  tester l well l, your meter will only average the readings you have taken
if you feel that an a1c below a 7 is keeping you too low, tell your doctor
a1c was 6.4 in march it was 5.5
i have had pretty good control (&lt;7 a1c) since being diagnosed 7 years ago and in the past 18 months i've gone from 6.1 to 5.8
tml english i went for my diabetes check today and my a1c was 7.2
my a1c was never over 6.5 highrst&hellip;now it is in the 7 range
i have achieved a 80 to.130 mg/dl bg level most of the time and had achieved an a1c of 5.5% (it is now a 6.2) and lost 65 lbs over a 5 mo period in 2011
when we were diagnosed his bg was 445 and his hgba1c was &gt;14, my bg was 382 and my hgba1c was 9.5%
jibber jabber, my a1c has been 7.5 or so for many years
once again i cannot stress enough i do not post this to rub it in anyone's face just letting everybody know how i am doing and that i am doing it for diabetics everywhere last time my a1c it was 9.2 y'all will all be on my mind when i ride on may 12th
my may 2011 a1c is 5.5, and i have dropped about 40 lbs in 6 months
tml english lastest a1c from aug, 9.2, today in oct 6.8, also insulin from 40 units dw to 25 units that's fantastic news tommy
my a1c went from a 10.7 to a 7.5 and i feel so much better
the major fight has to be to get you a1c below 7&hellip;the easiest way to do that is atkins
my may  a1c was 5.5
like trying to use oral diabetes drugs to drive a1c below 6.5 vs below 7.0
my a1c was really low, 4.8 and had dropped a lot - because it was normal for awhiles
i know if i increase my exercise level, i could get my hba1c into the mid to low 6's
i really have no choice as my a1c has been 12 for more than 2 years (that i know of - i had no health insurance for 3 years and did not test it&hellip; but i can tell you what helped me before and what is helping me now
since my a1c last week at 11%+ and a not-so-good discussion with my endocrinologist,  i've hit the glucose meter hard and completely rearranged my schedule
a small success leading to a normal a1c in a few months :-) that&#39;s the way to do it
my a1c has been under 6.5 while on januvia
my a1c is 6.8 needs to be 6.5-7.0
good luck  ps my june a1c sas 8.9 and sept was 6.9 stoped all pasta potatos rice and all bread but my e muffens in the am asnd have so fare lost 25 lb
edie could not find sept so i put this on aug but will now post (i like to show off )  ilost 20 lbs  took 20 points off my coles 140 to 120 and my a1c went from 8.8 to 6.9 wow
my a1c dropped from 7.3 to a 6.2
works like a charm for me, with an hba1c in the low 6% range and no hypos at all
while i was on the nph my a1c levels were anywhere from 6.5 to 6.1
when i managed my t2d by my meal plan alone, i regularly had a1c levels of 5.5
at that time i dropped my a1c from 8.6 to somewhere in the 7's
last a1c was 7.1, so i find it absolutely essential
based on what i saw, i expected an a1c of 5.2 to 6.2 given possible variances in the time of the readings, accuracy of the meter, etc&hellip;and i ended up pulling a 4.7 which surprised even me
my a1c at the hospital was 8.4
(although an a1c of 6.9 is on the high end of diabetics in good control and not so very bad
(a1c was then 6.3) thank you again for taking the time to respond and i will continue to learn all that i can and pray for healthier lives for all of us
my a1c was 11.2 and my fasting blood sugars were 209
even with keeping an a1c of 6.3 i have gastroporesis (so eating is not easy) and nerve damage in my foot (walking is very painful)
tml english i had an appointment with my doctor at the beginning of february and my a1c was at 5.7 which is pretty good
my sugar was 328, a1c 12.2, cholesterol 252, triglycerides are 411 plus other things being out of whack
my a1c was 7.2
my a1c was never higher than 6.2 during the 20 years that i have had diabetes
i've been on it for just over 1 month and my a1c has gone from 8.2 to 6.6
a1c can give you an idea about the level  of blood glucose in the past 3 month    dr ali have a nice day you a1c is a blood lab test reading that shows your average "sugar" reading from the previous three months
your a1c is like a time bomb, if it's too high all kinds of internal problems could happen, it tells your body that your diabetes is uncontrollable so you want to keep your a1c below 7.0
a1c is an abbreviation for hemoglobin a1c (also abbreviated as hba1c
i'm a type 2 dx nov 2010 with a1c of 6.9
last 3 a1c's(6 mos
my last a1c was 6.7
kind of depressing too, just brought my a1c to the lowest its been since i was diagnosed 18years ago and now its all over the place
29767-a1c-of-5-5
howdy thirtyone   according to the ada: "for people without diabetes, the normal a1c range is 4-6%
i had already been dx'd with t2 for several years and i had an a1c of 5.5 so perhaps you may need a 2nd opinion on it
so many people come to me during our seminars and tell me they don't understand why they get fasting bloods of 100  or 125 and when they go to their physicians and get their ha1c its 7.5 or even an 8
your ha1c is your average blood sugar reading for the past 3 months &mdash;  it tells you exactly where you are and where you've been for the past 3 months
visit i had a a1c of 5.4
your ha1c is so very close to coming into a normal range of 4.5 to 4.8 that with a little work and a bit more education (you are already off to a great start in knowing about carbs, etc
it was also traced to attribute to the severe allergies, and then in oct 08 they said her pancreas was also being affected but a1c came back normal 5.3
she was getting readings over 200 suddenly so another a1c was ordered, it was 6.9 (still normal by some standards) so nothing was done, then jan 22, 09 they took a look at all the readings i'd done on her and said " she's definitely diabetic and its type 2
my goal is to keep my a1c's in the 6's
lowest a1c to date, that im super proud of is 6.9~ after a high of 10.4, 2 years ago
these minor components include hemoglobin a1c, a1b, a1a1, and a1a2
hemoglobin a1c (hba1c) is a minor component of hemoglobin to which glucose is bound
well i was diagnosed last august with an a1c of 14
between my immediate change in my diet, exercise, and taking my medicine (januvia and lantus insulin), i got down to an a1c of 5.6 at the end of january (i get my new a1c results this thursday)
my a1c is currently 7,9, i am trying to get my sugar dopwn
tml english here is the lastest and greatest  a1c 5.7 a little up from the last one bp 118 over 62 overall cholesterol 155 hdl 56mg ldl 87mg triglycerides 61mg b12 very good vitamin d 25 hydroxy level 41 doctor said i was healthy except for being diabetic lol
all this did get my a1c down from 6.4 to 5.4 but one thing i noticed that did not change is the fasting levels
i just had fasting blood work done last thursday and it came back with a1c at 6.1 and bs at 124
i went to my endocrinologist today for my 3 month check up and my a1c is 9.3, it's a lot better then the 10.7 i was at
a1c-6, 2hr after meals-145-160
because of a a1c 6.5 last year
my morning numbers were great, but my a1c jumper to 6.4 or6.7
lower my a1c to &lt; 5.7  and to be more compassionate and strive for more serenity
my a1c will get below 7 and will be maintained at 6.5 at most, for the 1st time ever
get my a1c down to 5.5 if possible
he said it will get better, my thyroid is on key, he checked the a1c and it was 9.7 down to 7.8
my last a1c was 6.9 and i'm hoping the next one is closer to 6.5
tml english hi all,   just went to my dr's and had my a1c tested it went down from 13 something to 7.0 dr was very impressed and my lipid numbers are much better as well i have gotten a bit lax with exercising and with eating veggies i only seem to like canned green beans
tfckmk988 just to expand in case some of you were wondering this was my a1c after 3 months from being diagnosed as edited in my reply below i meant to say, try putting up a picture of yourself up on your wall, of when you were at your ideal weight or a weight you want to get back to
i got my a1c down to 5.9 and have managed to stop my neuropathy from progressing&hellip;for now at least :)
i have lost almost 30lbs, gotten my a1c number down to 6.0 and my endo is very happy
from my one and only a1c of 13.7, i had diabetes for months before i was diagnosed
my a1c was 6.4
1/14/2014 fasting glucose 174, a1c 7.3 1/28/2015 fasting glucose 151, a1c 6.4 even though my expectations were not met today, it is still progress in the right direction
my a1c has ben 7 for years and years
i have maintained an a1c between 6.0  and 6.2 for 21 years
my hba1c is down to 5.8 which is exactly where i want it to be
39 lbs down &amp; a1c of 5.8
your a1c is averaged over 3 months, one day isn't going to make a bad a1c reading
when i was first diagnosed i was hitting 160 -180 about 2 hrs after eating but after 5 months on a pretty strict low carb diet i am now close to the normal range with an a1c of 5.3
my last hba1c was 6.6
brought my a1c down to 5.4
tml english last month my a1c was 7.5 this month it is 6.2
tml english 3 months ago my a1c was 13.2, i just received my lab results and 3 months later i am at 8.5,  i feel like i made so much improvement but still have room for more
was thinking i could get my a1c in the 7 percentile range unrealistic
it has taken me a longer time, but after being diagnosed a t1 (at over 40), it took me about a year to bring my a1c down from 8.3 to 6.7
howdy coleman welcome to dc that is fantasic that your a1c dropped that much in 3 mo
i understand that as a type 1 the lowest a1c you can achieve is somewhere in the 6s
here is a snippet from endocrine web reporting on the ada position on a1c:   "summary of a1c recommendations (nonpregnant) for people with diabetes1   &lt;18 years: &lt;7.5%1 adults: &lt;7.0%1 healthy adults with no comorbidities: &lt;7.5%1 complex/intermediate health: &lt;8.0%1 very complex/poor health: &lt;8.5%1"   there's more to the article see ~  http://www
getting your a1c's into the 7's is certainly realistic&hellip;and eventually, maybe even into the 6's
since starting on an insulin pump nearly 3 years ago, i've gotten my a1c back into the 6's and eliminated the really scary low bg's
last april my a1c was 6.8 and i'm hoping for a better one this month&hellip;awaiting lab results
my a1c's ran between 16.5,15.6, 14.2
he retired my pcp ( same office) that replaced him put me on lantus on 8/22 and in 10 days my a1c 10.2 my am fastings 134-155 rest 150 to 250 but right direction i hadnt seen a under 200 bs in years
this year my a1c went from 6.1-6.5 but am hypothyroid so undiagnosed trying to bring tsh and other numbers down
i have committed to lowering my a1c from 7.9 to 6.5 or under and lose 25 lbs
i lost 65 lbs in 5 mo, managed my t2 without diabetes medication (generally no more than 130 mg/dl fasting bg) and achieved an a1c of 5.5
since then i have lowered my a1c to 5.8, and both blood pressure and cholesterol levels/ratios are now ideal (and i lost 165 pounds)
i think the 130 in relation to the a1c is speaking about the new charts that have been put out that give you a range of meter readings that indicate about what you can expect for your a1c number to be
the a1c doesn&#39;t read 130, but if your testing averages run around 130 then you can expect a fairly good a1c number
my a1c was 14
when i was first diagnosed, i had three fasting glucose readings greater than 120&hellip;my a1c was 8.5
my a1c was grater then 12  the meater was unable to read it lol well i was told 110 to 125 was pre and over that it was diabese
most medical staff in america as far as can be determined administer the a1c test twice before they diagnosis an individual with pre-diabetes or type 1 or type 2
my a1c was only 5.6 at that time, yet my numbers on the test were indicative of diabetes
with the a1c anything over 130 as of 2007 is considered diabetic with the ada
another problem with it is a low a1c (like 5.4) could be incredibly dangerous if a lot of low blood sugars contributed to it
the a1c has never been used for diagnosis and it's only been this year that some criteria has been put around it so it can be used for diagnosis and that was 6.5+ is diabetes
i would like to see the sources for your information hi, my a1c level 2 months ago was 5.7, my non-fasting level was only 57,had fasting glucose level,it was 104, at that time i was told pre-diabetic
a1c's were always in the 6's untill late last year when it was 9.3
after all those years, i realized the problem was that i was too aggressive in trying to maintain a low a1c&hellip;aiming for the 5's
aim for a slightly higher a1c&mdash;being in the 6's is good enough
my publicly stated goal is to achieve an a1c of 5.6 or less, i am not worried about the lipid panel or any of the other tests
let us now if u did it good luck steve trying not to be over confident &hellip; the 30 day average on my meter is 107 &hellip; been on this merry-go-round long enough to know that means very little i use to try for an a1c in the 5's, but ended up with too many hypoglycemic reactions
three months ago my a1c was 5.8
i understand how you feel i will have my first a1c test since finding out  i have t2 next monday and i am nervous but excited too
i cannot wait till my a1c comes back next week to see if i can give up the insulin and stick with pills,  doctor said if it was 7 or below i could go off and see if the pills will work as well
new studies &mdash;every one recommends to keep a1c &mdash;under 6 &mdash;i am happy with under 7
i've maintained an a1c of 6.0 with variations occasionally of  two tenths of a point
i do question the idea of a person with diabetes that maintains an a1c much below 6.0
a person without diabetes, that eats a nutritionally balanced food plan will accomplish an a1c well below 6.0 naturally
to maintain an a1c much below 6.0, i strongly suspect a diabetic would most likely be ingesting an insufficient amount of carbs, or taking an abundant amount of medication
in fact i have written up a discussion which tells of my meal plan whereby i have been able to keep my bg in the 80 to 130 mg/dl range, have an a1c of 5.5%, lose 65 lbs over the course of 5 mo
a1c was 6.1
but, many doctors would draw a big question mark on that one&hellip;how i had an a1c of 8, 16, 5.9, etc i cannot explain fully&hellip;anne i feel same way
and responded beautifully to that&hellip;however, now my a1c is too low&mdash;&mdash;weird&hellip;real weird&hellip;in the meantime, even though my a1c is low, my range everyday is all over the map&mdash;-it has been for years&hellip;i am very brittle&mdash;&mdash;-very tired, with current a1c only 5.9 again&hellip;yes, that sounds like a perfect number, but i feel bad at that number&mdash;-like i am flying on a plane that is too low&mdash;&mdash;i don't understand why i have to go through all of this&hellip;i honestly don't understand it, but i realize it is not god's fault, so i pray really hard to him every night&hellip;huh&mdash;&mdash;i went to a free clinic 3 months ago, got a really good doctor, and he said " oh, my god"&mdash;-i said " what
he said " i have practiced diabetes for years, and never seen a type 2 that oscilates between 83 and 600-700, but i also have never seen a type 1 that ever has an a1c of 5.9"&mdash;-wonderful&mdash;-i tested positive for the antibodies type 1 test a long time ago&mdash;-my c-peptide showed barely type 1&mdash;&mdash;-god, i am so tired of this&mdash;&mdash;seriously, my numbers are always between 83 and 600-700 everyday&mdash;-that's not normal&hellip;glad i am only 41, and not 81
i am pretty mad because i have diabetic seizures , yet, 2 out of three doctors guaranteed me i am type 1&mdash;-then, over last 4 years i feel like crap at an a1c of 5.9&mdash;&mdash;even 5.3 at times&mdash;it's been an 8 before, then at one point another diabetic test translated my a1c over to a 16&mdash;&mdash;-i'm tired, just dogged tired
yes&hellip;i agree with you completely&hellip;i failed to explain that whenever they see  any of my low a1cs at all, they say no insulin, then, what happens is , i continue to spike into the 500s and 600s and keytones after eating everyday, and the hospital confirmed several times that they found the same numbers&hellip;the hospital has always found all of this&hellip;then, when i go to a doctor, the doctor says " i don't want to focus on the hospital, as the hospitals cannot diagnose
however, my a1c dropped down to 5.9 at some point, and he said " i have also never had a type 1 patient with an a1c of 5.9
my last a1c however, confused him&hellip;i did not blame him for that&hellip;it dropped way low&mdash;&mdash;i have been tracking down my highs and lows more, and recording them more often, and i am astounded&hellip;when my a1c was 5.9, my highs were in the 400s-600s, and my lows were in the 50s
my a1c has been all over the map &mdash;-particulary 4 years ago&mdash;-8, 16, 7.3, 5.3, 6.0, 5.9, i am so brittle it is hard to pinpoint any consistency
i have noticed if any doctor i have tried so far sees a low a1c at all, they focus completely on that, then all of a sudden they hand me the bill, kind of shrug, then they say they have to get going&hellip;the long acting insulin i had in the emergency room cleared up my vision , stabilized me really really good&hellip;any doctor i have seen prior to this last one said " i don't want to see the record of what the hospital gave you, because a hospital cannot diagnose&hellip;" or, they say " well, you've gotten by this long without insulin again&hellip;2 years, so, you'll be fine&hellip;"  then, again, they leave&hellip;well, i will just stay focused on this last doctor&mdash;-time will work everything out, i am positive it will, what i meant to say is that god will keep staying with me&hellip;i credit him for everything that is good&hellip;and i remind myself that it's not god's fault if some doctors are hurtful
i tested positive for the type 1 antibodies test a long time ago, and my c-peptide  showed barely type 1&mdash;-i am beyond tired, am sitting on a low a1c, in the meantime, every time i find another doctor&mdash;i have gone through 5 in the last 7 years, i get treated like crap&mdash;-why me
my a1c was 9.9 (i expected it to be higher) my glucose was 163 my total cholesterol was 200  my hdl was 39  my ldl was 123 my vldl was 38  my triglycerides was 192   i go back to the doctor this wednesday and we are going to discuss these numbers more in detail and start some sort of meds i'm sure
bg's are running around 225 today (fasting 238, after bkfst 226) my most recent a1c was 9.8
my a1c went from 14.1 to 5.9 in 4 months
i was able to keep my bg (blood glucose) levels in the 80 to 130 mg/dl range, achieve an a1c of 5.5%, and lost 65 lbs over 5 mo
my a1c's dropped from the 7's and back into the 6's
my a1c was 13 at time of diagnosis but now it is 6.4
my last a1c was 6.8 and i expect the next one in august to be lower
well, it really helped very much and over the past 4 months, my a1c has dropped 2 whole points without me doing anything different other than taking this pill
my a1c at the time was 12
it's a glucose monitor it's awesome and no you need a prescription, but it's awesome it's brought my a1c to a 6.0 and warns me when my sugar is falling or rising and it's a neat lil thing and i don't have to check my sugar as many times a day
and my last a1c was 6.6
2 hour glucose fasting test showed an average of 140 bg over the past 3 months, and an a1c of 6.5
an a1c of 5.7 isn't high enough to really consider diabetes, what was your glucose level when it was tested, fasting and not
my first a1c was 5.7, my second after losing weight and exercising more, eating better was 5.4 and i am definitely diabetic
my a1c is 5.5 and im at2 diabetic i take metformin 1000 er once a day right now but was told i may need another med with it or insulin sooner than later so i would advise u to have the 3 hour test done
another thing, just because your a1c is "normal" does not mean you do not have prediabetes of t2
you can have highs which are balanced out with lows, since the a1c is an average of your bg#s over 3 months
yet her a1c  would be in the 6.5 range
y last few a1c's have been 5.6, 6.5, 5.4, 5.4, 5.2, and 5.4, and i am a full blown t2 diabetic my meds are 1000 mg of metformin 2x a day and 15 units of lantus
i get an a1c every 3 months and meet with my doctor for the results
my a1c is horrible - 10.3
the lowest my blood sugar ever has been a1c of 7
i have my 1st follow up a1c and fear this last 2 weeks will mess it up&hellip;color me puzzled and worried
there is snowball chance in hell that i am "non diabetic" just because my a1c dropped to 5.4
my initial a1c was a 9.1, and when i go in in april for my 3 month, i'll have blood work done and then a week later i'll have my appointment with her to go over the numbers
had different blood works done and one reading was 222 and had asked doctor about it she had an a1c done and that was 217 with an 9.1 so hopefully the next one will be better
i am so glad to find someone else who has these issues too (not glad we have them, but you know what i mean :) i was taking huge bolus doses of levamir xl every morning and every night and novolog in between, and my a1c was still 15
my a1c is back up to 11.6 (oof, i know
(i am not nearly as active as you and considerably older:  i allow myself 120 grams of carb per day and my last a1c was 6.6
i had gotten my a1c to 5.5, lost 65 lbs in 5 mo, discontinued my insulin injections and kept my bg levels in a normal range by following a high protein low carb meal plan
in that time i've have had an a1c of 5.5
the benefits are a1c's under 5.5 for three years and average bg  in the high 80's and 90's this entire time
read my discussion titled "you have to be your own analyst" it may help you gain control and reduce your a1c1 and blood sugar levels
fasting and before meals blood sugar should be between 80-110 and your a1c should be 6 or under
my last a1c was 6.7 in december
my a1c is 12 which is insane
my hba1c results have always been high (over 11%) but last week at clinic i'm back down to 7% (which is brill for me
not to mention a1c below 7 how can that be
and my a1c went to 5.4, she told me i had "mild" diabetes
i also do not think looking back that she should have ever put me on pills to start with when my a1c was 5.6
and my a1c went to 5.4, she told me i had "mild" diabetes
i also do not think looking back that she should have ever put me on pills to start with when my a1c was 5.6
i already have the feeling my a1c is not below 7.1
i'm hoping for a below 7 a1c but i think it might be higher than 7
(consult your medical team before attempting this)   in order to wean yourself off of your diabetes medications (unless you are a type 1 diabetic, type 1 diabetics must take insulin for life) you must first condition your body to get off of the medications, in order to do so you must have your a1c level at 6.5 or below, and have managed your blood glucose level for at least 9 months, this allows your body to get accustomed to having such control so that you can slowly reduce both the dosage of your medication as well as the amount of food that you eat at every meal
last a1c was 5.5 and my sugar tests all under 125 next blood test will be 8/30
i currently test my blood glucose 12-15 times per day to keep my a1c below 5.5
my last a1c was 13+
my average a1c is 6
if caught in the very beginning&hellip;to nourish the body and spank your beta cells back to life (grin)&hellip;i know my insulin sensitivity has improved a great deal&hellip;my a1c is 5.0 and i no longer take meds
since starting my sliding scale this past december, my a1c dropped almost 3% since then (the first time in over 10 years) plus i take 60 units of levimir in the morning and 20 units at night instead of just the one shot every 24 hours i have been type 1 for 22 years and i have been out of control a majority of that time

there are many things that affect your a1c reading and you should be aware if you have many lows or if you donate blood, this can lower your a1c
my a1c has been more or less the same for the past 2 years so i'm not convinced that constantly checking makes much difference &hellip; other than occasionally causing a bit of stress
(btw &hellip; i am type 2 on metformin only and fairly well controlled with an a1c of 5.8) there is some research that seems to support not testing:  http://bit
despite these issues, my a1c remains between 6.1 and 6.3
i work out twice a day, not on meds and a1c 5.7 i do agree that testing doesn&#39;t really change much in a type 2&#39;s day
my a1c is 5.1&hellip; i will test at least for a while at minimum before every meal and when i wake up (although breakfast and the wake up one tend to be the same test just due to time) i will never give up testing&hellip;i test a lot less frequently than i use to&hellip;but i still test at least twice a day&hellip;things change&hellip;and i want to stay on top of things&hellip;as for this research&hellip;to me it is dangerous&hellip;you already have doctors running around telling type 2s they don't need to test&hellip;i am very sure they're plenty of people running around eating the ada recommended diet and not testing who have no idea their diabetes is out of control&hellip; i guess things change &hellip; but i just checked my lab records and since 2008 i have been between 6.1 and 5.8 so i have poked my fingers a whole lot to what end
honestly i don't see the purpose of testing your own a1c as it's an average of 3 months
i am aware of those a1c machines, but for the rest of the a1c done through the dr office was done with phlebetomist and sent off in a vial
after 15 years of struggling to get my a1c under 7, i finally checked in with 6.4
my readings are such that i got an a1c of 4.7   i do not think the metformin has a lot to do with it&hellip;it is the diet/exercise changes in my opinion
very scary, i don't know how many glucose tabs i ate, but it was a bunch    i am now the proud owner of a glucagon emergency kit and i will not hesitate to use if i get below 50 again   with the results of my blood showing my a1c being 6.0 last week my hcp agreed with me it might be a time to cut back on my insulin dosage it's good that your staying on top of the situation
but i have things back in order with a a1c of 6.8 my lowest ever at my last appointment
but, when my a1c hit 9.6 i knew i had to try something else
karyn dear melissa, your a1c is an average of your bg readings over the past 3 months
she kept taking her insulin on an empty stomach, and she drove her a1c down to 3.3
i had an advanced degree rehab specialist tell me that she had never seen a1c numbers close to mine in 20 years of work, including type 2 patients
my a1c was 5.6 - 5.9 for many years, but now around 7 or so, because i can't take the activity that i used to
i have achieved an a1c of 5.5 and have lost about 50 lbs of weight since feb 2011
achieve an a1c of 5.5%, lose 65 lbs over the course of 5 mo
and lastly, despite the fact that my physical just came back with a bp of 109/75 and a1c of 4.8, ldl of 65, hdl of 45, my doc got angry because my number are not near low enough and wants to double all my meds
tml english i don't know what i'm doing wrong but my blood sugars has been fine but my a1c was 5 last month
i manage to keep my blood glucose levels close to normal, have an a1c of 5.5, and have lost about 50 lbs
i was a1c 11.1 in may 2009 and am now 5.4
the deterioration is not reversible, so you need to get your a1c in the 6's immediately if not sooner
beating my a1c of 9.8 is not good
my a1c is 11.3 after this i havent seen a doctor just because of the whole insurance stuff
i started my "food choice" plan just over 3 months ago, and my second visit after the 3 months was: a1c 6.1 and now 14 pounds off
my doc pretty much said heres ur pills and sent me on my way my a1c was 9.3 so i know that s not really high but high
i know i have to exdersie i weigh 276 ilbs but im so tired all the time and if i could id sleep all day please help hi,  when i first got diabetes,  my eyes went blurry &amp; my a1c was 10.3
i was able to keep my bg levels in normal range, my may 2011 a1c was 5.5 and i have lost about 50 lbs
a1c 14.1, four months later it was 5.9, i believe in drinking lots of water and eating low carb vegetables
consider that the ada recommends a1c 7.0 or lower&hellip;and that translates to average bg of 154 - and damage starts at 140
my bs was 134 and my a1c was 7.1
i have a meal plan i developed myself which got me off all diabetes medications (in my case nph insulin) and kept my blood glucose (bg) levels in the "normal" range, my a1c at 5.5 and i lost 65 lbs over 5 mos as well
my a1c has been 6.3%, but i constantly feel drained
lol i'm proud to say my last reading on my a1c was 5.9
i went from an a1c of 13.5 down to an 11 last month
one way or another i will get there even if only 1 number lower for the a1c but hopefully i get down 3-5 numbers lower
lol i would like to get my a1c in to the 4's
with the 7.6 a1c, it sounds like your body is not metabolizing all the food you eat, resulting in higher than desired bg's and a higher a1c
my a1c is 7.6
in 13 years with this disease, my a1c's have gone form 7.5 to 6.3 and lower( last one in june 5.9)
i don't know what my a1c was, as i wasn't aware that there was a thing as an a1c reading
getting an a1c will tell you your average blood sugar these past 30 days
my solution is to test often, understand what i'm eating, and take it from there&hellip;the goal is to achieve an a1c in the 6's
moe i respectfully disagree with your statement "how you get there doesn't matter" in regards to getting your a1c in the 6s
my late bride had an a1c of 6.0 yet within the 90 day period she received the a1c she had bgs of  300 to 600
i still use mdi(syringes) using novalog and levimire insulins and am able to ave 5.8% a1c's this past 12 mo ave period
i'm able to maintain my weight at 120 lbs (i'm a 5'3" 64 year old female, moderately active) and keep my a1c in the 6's by limiting my carb grams to no more than 120 grams per day
if you can keep your a1c down below 7 that is good, 6.5 is even better
my a1c went from 14.1 to 5.9 in 4 months
tml english i've been on actos for over a year&hellip;i've had to change my diet because it's carb based&hellip;my a1c is almost to normal range (it's 6.5)&hellip;since it's normalized i notice i have lows more often like going from 130 to 65 in an hour after taking it if i eat first then meds)&hellip;anyone else have issues
my a1c was only 5.6 (my cholesterol numbers weren't good and they all needed to improve which they did later) i am doing really well, but i sure have not reversed it yet
my last a1c, which was over a year ago (i need to have it done again but going to pay my doctor bill of first) was 5.4 i know my doctor said it was caught early
keep your a1c below 7.0, watch your diet, exercise, and keep your weight down
when my a1c went down to 5.4, one of the diabetic education specialists (they always phoned to go over things with me) talked as if it was in remission for a while or something, she was very impressed
my pcp just diagnosed me  as being  type 2 because of symptoms and a1c  at 6.5 (i think, cant remember)
hi lynn, an a1c of 5.7 and 6.4 is prediabetes  alan i'm a little new here myself&hellip; so it seems there are 2 conversations going
that is a blood sugar that stays within 70 to 110 at all times and an a1c below 5.5
tml english ive been diabetic now for 6 years&hellip;and i did well for like the first year and a half, got my a1c down to 7 something, the last time i had my a1c done it was over 13
i got serious about my control and have gotten my a1c down to 5.9 over the past couple of years
in april my a1c came back 6.6&hellip;i
i have been able in the last year to bring my bg into a very good range and drop my a1c from 12 to 5.5
in an attempt to regain an hba1c in the 6's (last one was 7.0), i've begun to exercise more
my lowest hba1c was 5.9 back in 2005&hellip;i'd be happy with it in the mid-6's but lately it's been a struggle to keep it in the high 6's and now it's crept to 7
i would also like to point out that our daughter's first a1c test was normal, however as the disease had only begun there wasn't 3 months of data from her system available
i hope your a1c is 6
my a1c is 6 and the dr and i are very happy
my a1c has gone from 7.1 down to 5.7 and i expect that it will be around 5.4 at my next test
i asked him what that meant &hellip; his response was keeping my a1c under 7.0 &hellip; my a1c was 5.8 at the time, to which his response was "huh"
tml english when i was diagnosed on 2/25 i had my first  diabetic  counceling appointment  on 2/28  the diabetic center associated  with cape cod hospital   treated me  very well gave me loads of good advice  my a1c was approx 13% then in april  my aic  was done again  it  went to  8.9 %
my a1c went down from 8.0 to 7.0
a little high in sugars / carbs but i haven't had an a1c above 7 in about ten years so i figure i'm doing ok
a1c went from 10.6 to 6.2  in 5 months
i have been following this basic pattern (intermittent fasting) for about 6 months and my a1c last week was 5.7 (lowest since diagnosis) and have been taken off metformin
but one thing i wanted to mention was the dueling a1cs my mom and i took&hellip;she came in at 5.9 (med free)&hellip;i came in  at&hellip;wait for it&hellip;wait for it&hellip;4.9&hellip;so tell me
some good news came to me recently though that i wanted to share, my a1c is now 5.3 and i feel great about it
my a1c is 6.5
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
i'm thinking that she is waiting for my a1c test on 9/24 before she decreases anything
my last a1c was 7.5 and the doctor told me he doubted if i even had diabetes due to all my asthma meds
tml english so for the past year and a half, my a1c has been ranging from 9.0-12.6
tml english had my blood drawn for my latest a1c and all my other health markers last week&hellip;am going wed to the doc  wed to get my results&hellip;so i have started eating way more veggies at each  meal&hellip;i eat servings of 4 or 5 different veggies with both lunch and dinner&hellip;so much for the 5 a day
before then, i'd call my blood sugar management and food choices unsatisfactory (a1cs around 7.5-8.5 - not awful, but unsatisfactory on my personal scale), but within the last 6 months i've reshaped everything
my a1c has been around 5.9 - 6.2
i can't get my a1c below 6.4 lately
i started carb counting at the beginning of the year due to my december a1c being 10.8% and it had improved my numbers so much
monday i had an a1c done it is now 7.5% and the only thing i changed was counting my carbs
since i got the pump all you have to count are the carbs like sandwich bread is 15 grams per slice so you figure you eat 30 per sandwich and if you input that into the pump it will figure out how much insulin you'll need depending on your sugar at that time that seems pretty simple i hope i can do it cause i really want the pump it's really cool i love mine my a1c is 6.4 and used to be like 15 ( i was hard headed) the only thing is that have to remember to cover it when you go on rides at disneyland so it won't get drenched   ;-)) howdy sweetburr,   there are several resources right here on dc
my a1c's are below 6.0, so we are both happy
my a1c's have dropped down to 9.3 ( from 15.7 3 or 4 years ago)
my last a1c went up to 9.5&hellip; hey allison - can you give us a little more info on your current regimen
still have ups &amp; downs but for the most part more stable an controlled &hellip; a1c of 13.7 went down to 7.5 and doctor as well as myself think it will be even lower next time &hellip; i don't know if my experience will help in anyway &hellip; yet if you ever need to vent or a listening ear etc &hellip; i'm here , i'll listen &hellip;
my a1c has hovered around 6.0 ever since i was diagnosed, without exaggeration
i know many are shooting for a lower a1c, then 6.0
it does take time to get things under comtrol, but after 2 mos of diet and insulin my numbers were already dropping and in dec my a1c was at 6.4
tml english hi all my name is john  am 45 yrs old  since march of this yr have lost over 70 lbs  due to unknown cause, and my sugar have been skyrocketing but my a1c stays around 5.1-5.3  am type 2  take metformin 500 mg twice daily  dont use sugar at all except what is allready in products but just get low sugar or sugar free products any suggestions  will see gp in january how old is the a1c score
om/health/a1c-test/my0
they were not really interested in the fact that my a1c went from 7.5 to 6.8 and when i raised the problem of higher fasting bg, they right away said that may be i should go on meds
diet, a few supplements, quitting alcohol, exercise, acupuncture, meditation, stress reduction, some the usual suspects, have brought me to an hba1c today of 5.5
i was diagnosed with an a1c of 14.1 and by eating lots of low carb vegetables and cutting out most high carb foods my blood sugar dropped to normal levels in about 3-4 months
i think we should make his goals alil higher until his body adjusts to the changes then gradually lower to the excepted goal when he was diagnosed his a1c was 11.9 and glouse was 366
hope this is helpful, lin hey jo thats how my numbers run after meals between 120 and 150 and my docter tells me thats fine cause even with that number i have dropped my a1c to 5.9
he takes great care of his diabetes, doesn't have a perfect a1c but what i've read it's round the 7% mark which is far from bad and he generally has the right idea about nutrition, exercise, management techniques and the physical and mental difficulties that come along with having diabetes
a a1c result of 7 can be as high as 7.5 or as low as 6.5
but a person with diabetes can can have a blood cell turn around in as little as 81 days and in a non diabetic it can be as long as 146 days which will show a higher than normal a1c because the cells have been accumulating sugar for 146 days not 90
(there are other, far more technical reasons too)   steve take all test results with a grain od salt&hellip;even your home bg monitor can be off by10-20 points&hellip;just the way it is&hellip;i use to freak about numbers&hellip;now my goal is stability&hellip;i have managed to bring my a1c down to about 4.8&hellip;i realize that any one individual reading is not a pattern&hellip;you should be looking for patterns and not individual numbers on any test&hellip;a a1c test that shows 7
we do the best we can with what we got &hellip;   steve jibber, also how long did it take you to lower your a1c to 4.8 and what were your numbers previously
thanks i have no idea what my a1c was at diagnosis&hellip;but it took about 91/2 mos to get to under 5&hellip;my fasting bg at diagnosis was 386&hellip;it is now in the upper 70's most days&hellip; how were you able to lower your a1c levels
what i don't understand is why you are still diabetic when the threshold for diabetics is an a1c range higher than 6.6 that is what i was told by the nurse at my recent blood test results
my a1c came down from a 10.7 to 8.7 and i go back to my doc in two weeks so here's hoping for a better number
nd nuts&hellip;everything else has been cooked&hellip;i don't know what my starting a1c was because my doctor at the time was  (be nice catherine) not an expert in the field of diabetes&hellip;but my fbg was 386&hellip;my fbg was 81 this morning
and my last a1c ( a home test) was 4.9
in 2 to 3 months don't know what else to do my a1c level is 11.9 that stinks need to lower have you done one of those basil tests where you eat nothing for 8 hours and test yourself every 30 minutes and see if you basil rates are set correct
that was because over the past 18-20 months, my a1c's had climbed into the 7's and i was experiencing scary morning lows
my may 2011 a1c was 5.5, where it had been hovering 6.9 or so before
when i was diagnosed my fasting sugar was 225 and my a1c was 8.8
my a1c is 5.4
tml english i went to my docter and my a1c was 5.1 i thought that was good but she told me it not good at all ,     she said i need to stay between 5.5 and 6.0 so now i feel lost what is good or bad i can not tell when i am high or low on my blood sugar unless i test great discussion
when i was diagnosed with type 1, my a1c was 13.7
i to found my a1c at 14.9 back in 1989 and used metformin
he wants my a1c between 5.5 and 6.0 because he feels that anything below 5.5 is more likely to cause an increased number of hypos
he recently had an a1c of 4.9 and he does not have hypos
i feel it is healthy to have an a1c that is as low as 5.1 or even lower as long as it is not causing you to have a lot of hypos, especially ones that cause you to lose consciousness or require that you have assistance
it is desirable to keep your a1c below 6.0 because that is a nondiabetic level and that means it is much less likely that you may experience diabetic complications in the years ahead
if you are taking metformin only, an a1c of 5.1 is great, as that drug by itslf generally doesn't produce hypoglycemia
i only have personal experience with that drug, and my a1c hangs around 5.5 & 5.6 with  marginal control of my diet  (i watch what i eat but i don't obsess over it)
two hours later, as i was even more hungry i tested again (my a1c was just tested at 5.6) and post-prandial reading was 177
a normal non-diabetic patient should have an a1c of 4-5
fair winds, mike i used to test twice a day for 6 months after i was diagnosed with type 2, and then once a day for the next 3 months and when my doc saw my a1c results, he told me to test once a week 2 to 3 hours after dinner
a1c is 5.5, and a recent ct scan of my heart reveal that i had no cholesterol plaques in my heart or aorta
my a1c is 5.5
my a1c had actually increased before this change, my dr does not believe type 1.5 exists despite me explaining that i was following the symptoms that i had been told about
i am new here also its my first day to and have had type two diabeties for 3 years, my a1c is over 10 my weight is about 300 and i am only 5'4'' so as you can tell i am a mess also
i have been a diabetic for 20 years and have never had an a1c under 7.5
betty   last year i was diagnosed with fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
four months later my blood sugar was down close to normal numbers and my a1c dropped to 5.9
tml english even if you do everything right,  such as eating right, exercise, take you medicines ,,and keeping your a1c very low, you still still walk away from the doctors office feeling like you have done something wrong,  such as i did today, i have brought my a1c from 16 to 5,8 and kept it there for over a year now, plus lost weight, started exercising, ( go for walks every morning,  wow i am doing great ( so the doctor says ) until today when i was told because of my family history now i have to go on a different medicine because , even thought i do not eat sweets, i do not eat meats, i eat right, according to the doctor, fresh veggies, fresh fruits, lots of salads, , very little fish, lots of vitamins , walks, lots of water, some dairy,, ( i know i need more protein) but with all of this in  mind now he tells me , my triglycerides are way to high, now they are coming up to over 300 ,, now what,, more meds, i want to get off all this stuff, i am not sure what i am doing wrong here, , even my cholesterol(good one)  is in great shape, its 2 points above normal ,, and my bad is 10 pints above normal,, or where it should be at,,  so tell me doing every thing right, is it worth it even if things come back bad news,
a1c is 5.4, choleterol 138
thanks again, cindy hi hedi   well i went to the doctor again and they wanted to put me on more pills again, and i just flat said no,no more pills, so i am trying spices, and other things out, i went on this liquid vitamin, it has 0 calories, 0 carbs, 0 sugar, this has multi-vitamin & mineral (10 in one ), helps with stress, immune enhancer, energy( wow big help being a diabetic) bone & joints, cardiovascular, even memory enhancer, lol and i need this big time, but i like it  because its liquid, easy to take, any ways, i also started taking more spices, using my own, like cinnamon, ginger, basil, and others, but my point is, the doctor was trying to put me on more things and i said no, and went this way, i am doing great feeling great, i am walking every day, and when they had me on all the meds, i was told not to take vitamins with these meds, they dont mix well together, and i was starting to get where i did not want to go for my walks any more, , i did not want to end up like i was, so i stopped the doctors from giving me more, and started using these ideas, and now i have so much energy, and feel fantastic, so when i went back this last month, and they did my blood test, my a1c was 5.3 my reads were great and my triglycerides are down now , not where the doctor wants them,, but down, so something i am doing must be right, and although i appreciate the doctors trying to help me, i think i am doing just fine, at least my levels are way down from when i first found out i was a diabetic in 97 , my triglycerides were peaking almost 600 then and my sugar levels were up over, 400 , my a1c was 16 ,  yes with these levels i was in the hospital, that when i found out, i was a diabetic, so thats why after writing this when i came back from the doctor and had so many friends on here helping feel better, i do feel better, and i am going to keep doing what i am doing now, i know it can not be all wrong with  my test are showing can  not be  all that bad, so just keep doing what you are doing, you are on the right track, you don't need to feel like you always doing something wrong because your not, keep the faith in your self, as i had lost mine until all my friends on here, gave ti back to me, chin up, your doing great
well is that because i am taking the pills, or is it the diet and exercise&hellip;or all three&hellip; do not despair as it will only to serve you an injustice especially for all the strides you have made already look at it as just another curveball life is throwing at you your doctor should realize that his treatment should include not only the physical aspect but he should also be treating your mental health as well and support for your accomplishments to this point would go a long way we diabetics are a mentally fragile crew we need positive reinforcement constantly at least i do truly it is a nasty disease as if you let it - it will kill you - it makes you feel as if you have no control the reality is we do have more control especially in type 2 then we believe you have done great things for yourself, keep up the good work and don't let the doctor's disposition hurt your effort find a positive one if that's the case   my triglicerides spiked for a while my cholesterol was slightly elevated and i had fatty deposits on my liver i started drinking goji juice just  4 oz / day and by my next blood test these items all improved my a1c also dropped 2 percentage points from 9.1 to 7.1 not saying it is some kind of miracle juice but the proof is in the pudding the only change in my diet was the goji, in fact i was "bad" a few more times than i should have
y a1c is 6.1 and i am still on insulin&mdash;go figure that one
i am a type one for 25 years&mdash;5.6 a1c, triglycerides at 46, hdl at 86 and the rest is good as well&mdash;with no complications other than a slightly demented personality
i wish my a1c would get down to 5.8 i have been trying to get it down basically since i was dx'd in 2000 with type1
my last a1c was a 6.3 i believe
which is over the normal limit, but my first a1c when i got diagnosed was an 11.5, so i'm way happy with a 6.3 obviously
i've been told before that i may be type 1, and i've mentioned it to my doctor countless times, but he absolutely refuses to believe that i could be type 1 because he said "my a1c wouldn't be 6.3 if i was a type 1 only on metformin
my a1c never was accurate it turns out, because i was anemic to different degrees for the last 7 years, so my diabetes showed up like crazy in the from of keytones, seizures, and highs in the 300s-600, and lows in the 50s-anne shel,  please watch this video:  http://www
an a1c of 6.3 is fantastic
i focus on keeping an a1c of 7 or below
with an a1c of 7 or below, i can almost guarantee you , or anybody, will not lose a limb or go blind
if you keep your a1c at the 6s and even the lower 7s, all will be good
this will result in an a1c in the 6's which is good enough&hellip;obviously anything higher than that is dangerous
my last a1c was back down to 6.4
i have found i have kept my bg levels close to normal without the use of diabetes drugs (may 2011 a1c 5.5) and i have lost about 50 lbs in the 8 months i have been on the regimen
i also use the cgm (continuous glucose monitor) and have been quite satisfied with that device (my a1c's over the past year have ranged from 5.9 to 6.4)
tml english hi -  although diabetes runs in my dad's side of the family and i did see some side effects that were disturbing - i just put it out of my mind til that day last year when my a1c was a 13.6 and 'boom' punched in the face with the realization that i too had crossed that line
i have had spikes into the mid 200's and still had an a1c as low as 5.1
my late wife had bg levels ^ 300 for days yet she had an a1c of 6.0
her endo, when asked pointed out the a1c is a average of bgs over the last 30 days so if she had lows (and she did, frequently) showed up as a lowered a1c
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
my last a1c in march was 6.1
i just recently found out that i (a1c level of 5.7), and my six year old son (a1c level of 5.9) are in the risk areas for becoming diabetics
my last hba1c was 6.9 and there's some room to improve there but my endo is happy
i had my a1c under control for 5 or 6 years &amp; was down to 2 metformin a day, 1 @ breakfast &amp; 1 @ lunch
for years my a1cs ran in the low 6's
specifically, i went off victoza and levemir&hellip;and with diet, exercise, and metforim&hellip;i was able to maintain an a1c of 6.5
i was immediately placed on insulin after being diagnosed, i see an endocrinologist regularly, and my a1c is consistently right around 7, but that's about the extent of my diabetes life and community
however, not good to start insulin when my a1c is 5.9&mdash;i would not want to go unconscious if i dropped too low
i now keep my a1c's in the 6.4-6.8 range regularly and also exercise 3 days a week
it's worked well, although i'm still trying to get my a1c below 6.9
my last a1c was 5.9 which is close to non diabetic levels
btw,my a1c sept 1st was 6.1
13224-a1c-5-1
at first he said that when they took my blood work my sugar was 268, but when the tests came back my a1c  was   5.1
i found that when my a1c was 5.9, my highs were in the 300s-600s, and my lows were in the 50s&mdash;&mdash;not good
that is why i do not care for the a1c, because a nurse or doctor looks at that one number&hellip;5.9, then he or she says to me " oh&hellip;this is excellent&hellip;your averages are only 123 or 126
then, they assume that my highs are rare, as in they assume i hit around 160s for highs, and that i am consistently in the 90s and 120s&mdash;&mdash;nothing could be farthest from the truth&hellip;so the next time i go in, i am showing them the wide range i have&hellip;i think it's great your a1c was 5.1&mdash;-maybe yours are more consistent than mine&hellip;that i do not know, so , didn't mean to scare you&hellip;i'm just so tired of being generically thrown in as " oh&hellip;hardly anything wrong with you
i was diagnosed with an a1c of 5.7, which is technically below standard goal, but i've been watching it for years and it has finally caught up with me
last a1c was 6.4 - i did a home a1c test, due to take anothr one, it has been 4 months since i did the test
i have been doing good controlling my levels over the past few months, even got my a1c down to 6.1 so far
we also did not have a 5 min a1c my first time getting tested it was a 6 hr glucose tolerance test
yet, i lost 30lbs and my hba1c was down to 5.4
fast forward the weight all came back(my thyroid meds were too high-reduced them 3 times) and my hba1c was back up to 6.6
she also wanted me to lose 10 pounds (which i have) and have brought my a1c from 6.5 to 6.2
he has now lost about 40 lbs, due to proper exercise, and has lowered his a1c numbers down from the 8-9 point range to a consistent 4.5-5 range
tml english hey guys my am bsl levels doing better now 101 not 80 i am not as nervous and i can go excercise without dropping so fast anyway hope when i go for annual physical next month a1c be under 9.2 trying to get them down good job on making them great changes,keep up the good work
we'll my a1c has always been high but now it's  getting a lot better i lost  5 pounds and i very happy about that
an a1c of 8.2 means that 8.2% of all of the red blood cells have glucose bonded to them
my goal is 80-180 with an a1c in mid 6's
my hgb a1c was 7.3-pretty stable
i'm trying to get my a1c back to what it was for many years&mdash;high 5s
i am working to get my a1c down to 7.0 keep up the good work
i am working to get me a1c from 9.5  keep trying it is so hard my advice is to buy a lot of dark green leafy vegetables and some yellow crooked-neck and zucchini, some nuts and cheese to use for snacks
a hgb a1c of 5 is just awesome
have a nice evening and day tomorrow people without diabetes typically have an a1c of 5
prediabetes is diagnosed with an a1c of 5.7-6.4 and diabetes with an a1c 6.5 or higher
guess what my a1c was this morning&hellip; 6.3
a1c in the 6's is good enough&hellip;have a good day
and the average for an a1c of 6.3 is 130
i love it when i&#39;m winning :) do the two of you have an &#39;ideal&#39; a1c you&#39;ve discussed with your doctors
so my a1c was 10.1 after the dka and my insulin dosage was 2 or 3 times what i use to take
last month i went back to see my doc and my a1c was 6.3, my insulin is back to normal, even i take a little less now and my bs is just fine
granted, i wouldn't have to take insulin or test;  but, even this is no big deal anymore since what i do regularly results in an a1c in the 6's which is good enough
i wrote how my a1c went from 14.1 to 5.9 in about 4 months here
good for you i heard that and i try that as well speak to your doc about any concerns,i have high cholesterol,but i am on meds for that and i follow a heart healthy ,diabetic diet&hellip;cut out the the bad fats,i try to go fat free as possible thank you i am doing that so we will see hello shorty31  ok here goes the numbers a normal a1c is 3.0-6.0 so it is slightly high but not bad, cholesterol normal is 140-199 so you are great there, hdl normal is 35.0-100.00 so yours is a little low, and your ldl normal is 0-129 and yours is good and tryglycerides normal is 0-200 so yes yours is high hey may stat you on a medication
a1c the a1c test may be used to screen for and diagnose diabetes in addition to monitoring the glucose control of diabetics over time
so i would ask my doc about a a1c of 7.0 and do some reading on the subject lots more out there than i thought
but also i do not think you need be to concerned a a1c is done every 3 to 6 month depends on the doc
my last a1c was 6.9 and my goal is to get it back into the mid-6's although my endo is happy with my bg's
tml english good article on understanding your a1c and some ideas of how you can have better management to achieve a better a1c
my a1c is 7.8
y 3 month a1c came back at 5.4 the end o dr my surgeon sent me to said great you can go off insulin
my pcp has been checking a1c every 3 months
in june my a1c had gone up to 11.5 and went on insulin,dropped starlix would not do the job alone, now on lantis and apidra, bs are coming back in line
i weigh 131 and my last a1c reading was 5.7 with average blood sugar of 104
he has been a bit concerned about mine at times when they raise to 120 or over but said he won't start meds as long as i can keep the average at least at 110 and below and my a1c stays below 7.0
i've lost23# and my a1c is 5.7
as my a1c count is 6.1
the thing to remember also when you are getting an a1c it&#39;s the average of your levels
ov/dm/pubs/a1ctest/   ~lynn @glucerna so far as i know there are 2 formulas for estimating your mean plasma glucose from your hba1c

from another article in diabetes forcast on the man who discovered the a1c protein there is this quote: "another recent development in the a1c test as a clinical tool is that experts now recommend using it to diagnose diabetes and prediabetes
an a1c of below 5.7 percent is considered normal, while a1c levels of 6.5 percent and above call for a diagnosis of diabetes
so from that we may understand the top end of "normal" for an a1c is 5.7,  an a1c of 6,5 and above means one has diabetes and between the 5.7 and the 6.5 may be considered prediabetic
my a1c has always run between 8.3 and 8.8 and neuroohy has just set in big time along w/ corpal tunnel to all, to all, watch your diet and exercise, don't allow this to happen to you
i was able to keep my bg (blood glucose) levels in the 80 to 130 mg/dl range, achieve an a1c of 5.5%, and lose 65 lbs over 5 mo,  all from eating a meal plan which was high protein and low carb
his a1c is 8.3, which is doctor said is good (they want it between 7.5-8.5 due to his age)
about a year ago, my a1c result yielded a 6.5% making me an official type 2 diabetic
then, four months later (feb 2015), my a1c climbed to 6.9%
oh&hellip;by the way, i had a1c's in the 6.2 to 6.6 range for three years before i got diagnosed
my a1c then was 6.6 - fast forward six months and i had severe polydipsia and polyuria&hellip;and working as i do for a nephrologist, i knew all too well what it probably meant
even i was horrified to learn my a1c at that time had shot up to 13.2
my a1c at dx was 12
you can get home kits for a1c that require a finger stick instead of a blood draw if it&#39;s that hard to get blood
i went from a 13.2 a1c to 4.7 in six months on diet, exercise, and metformin
ov/dm/pubs/a1ctest/ thank you for taking the time to research&hellip;very helpful&hellip;i will definitely ask my doc next week&hellip;i'm also going to ask why i need to do this every 3 months&hellip;most people here do it every 6 months
i wonder if they are doing other tests other than the a1c, because it was not required for me to fast for an a1c for quite a few years now
and no it was just a1c they told me before drawing my blood&hellip;i also asked if they needed my urine, but they said no&hellip;they did the last time&hellip;i will ask when i see my doc for my results&hellip;i really hate fasting &hellip; did they tell you what your a1c is
three months later, his a1c was 6.0, and considered to be non-diabetic
(copy of the meal plan is yours on request) i managed to keep my fasting blood glucose (bg) levels below 130, and my a1c was 5.5 plus i lost 65 lbs, which greatly lowered my body's insulin resistance
tml english i have heard that the ada has come out with a new guidline saying that a1c 5.7-6.1 was now considered pre diabetic and not type 1 or 2
i was diagnosed with diabetes (no such thing as being a mild diabetic either as my doctor once told me) my a1c to start with was 5.7 never heard of this not me
my last a1c was 5.4 (it was 14 when i was diagnosed last year)
by mid november she was having readings of 180-290 so an a1c was ordered, it came back normal at 6.2
well, as if slighted by my actions, they handed me a free meter for my daughter of her own, was told to test her in morning fasting and 2 hrs after dinner meal, they did her thyroid blood test, another a1c test, said to put her on a 300g carb diet a day and to make an appt
and told them what had happened, turns out there should have been a test done to actually determine whether laura was diabetic or not other than an a1c test the ogtt 2hr test
i was able to bring my a1c of 10.7 to 5.7 using magnesium(slo-mag),chromium picolinate,b-12, benfotiamine,turmeric,cinnamon&hellip;all come in capsule or tablets at health food store or on-line
tml english kept dr appointment today a1c  was 6.6 blood pressure was still high but coming down and had lost 8 pounds,since last visit
steve yes i'm having issues also,like when i put in a1c it gives me 87%
my most recent a1c was above 11 and this is obviously affecting my school performance
for this reason my a1c's have been in the 8's, and i often test and am in the 300's+, i rarely bolus b/c im so fearful of goin that low again
when i read this it sounded exactly like me i'm 21 and for a while now my sugars have been sitting high my a1c has been sitting around 9 and like u for the longest time i didn't care i just didn't care
my a1c is 6.9 just try it ok
we all share information on here, and listen to each other  my a1c was 6.1 yesterday, my goog cholestol had come up 14 points, but the doctor wants to leave me on my medication because she wants to see if it will change some more, because i have only been on this medication for a month now
you are also wanting to have dr do an a1c   the a1c test gives you a picture of your average bg control for the past 2 to 3 months
i have done well with it and currently my a1c is 6.2%  (non diabetes persons have a1c ranging from 4 to 5.5%)   i have written up my meal plan and make it available to any who ask for it
said if i get my a1c down to 5.5-6
tml english in spite of all the steroids and antibiotics and the massive infection this summer, my a1c came in at 5.7
my last three a1cs have all been between 5.5 and 5.8
not sure if you take something else with novolog but alone just bringing them down long term can be very dangerous i am proof  ask your doc about toujeo  i have only ever had an a1c in the low range 6.3 in the last month i went from leavimir and nph and a novolog sliding scale all day to 32 units of toujeo and an insulin carb ratio landing two days straight my sugars have not dropped below 76 and above 266 witch was my bad i messed up the new ratio until tonight that is going threw a threshold its scary but maybe it can help you get off novolog or lessing it  and the new treatments is not the cause of the threshold its years of high 300 and 400 days remember, those results were with the novolog weren't they
when i was last in to see my doctor for my a1c check it was down below 6 but the one thing i was so happy about was that my lipid panel showed that my cholesterol levels were at awesomely great levels - numbers were so much lower than i ever imagined
my management of it thus far (a1c 6.7) isn't enough
something came to mind while reading about you getting your a1c in the mail, last friday when we took laura to see the new ped endo, they did a 6 minute a1c test, the result was higher than that of the blood draw they did in denver on jan 22nd, anyone ever had this 6 min a1c done on them before or heard of it
my a1c was over 13 at the time
my initial a1c was 7.2 if i remember correctly
my last a1c in dec was 7.4, so in february my endo put me on bydureon and metformin
i would love to have a a1c of 7.2
my last a1c was 5.4 and my doctor's nurse told me it was like a "remission" but it would not always last, i do not believe one can truly reverse it, i think you can be in a remission though
i should also add that my a1c is 5.7 and my bgs run from 80-120 on a normal day, so i do have reason to say this is working
when i consider that i am now 67 years of age, walk 3 miles daily, push my 88 year old and 260 pound husband in a wheelchair &mdash; sometimes even jogging with him in his wheelchair &mdash; have normal blood glucose and a1cs, am of sound mind and good spirits, having no discernible illnesses, and feel better than i have in the last 20 years, that's all the proof i need
i am keeping my a1c in the 6 range, but i would like to improve more than that and be healthy in all aspects
gabby, i certainly agree that if you are following the basic plan to maintain your a1c in the 6's, then whatever else you do is a potential plus as you clearly describe
overall goal is an a1c in the 6's
tml english 3 months ago i went to my doctor with an a1c of 9.3
my a1c today was 7.9  he says today he wants me to take 4 mgs of amaryl
sheila i forgot to post that today my a1c was 7.9
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
a1c is a 2-3 month look at the average bg
i have done some research and many sites say that the a1c is tested during an 8 hour fast
tml english i'm happy, with my walking, my a1c is 5.6 avg is 114
i am glad to hear that your a1c is 5.6
i take 500mg of metformin daily and my physician checks my a1c twice a year and it is usually 5.3 or 5.4
now, my a1c is 6.5, cholesterol levels are fantastic, and i take nothing for high blood pressure
i keep my bg levels in or close to the normal range for about 5 months, and my a1c is 5.5 last may
plus i got my a1c from 13.5 to 6.0 in only 3 months also
but when i got my a1c down to 6.0 the burning stopped
at the time my bg levels were in the 400's and my a1c was 12.5
my a1c went from 5.5 to 8.2
a1c was 11.5 last ck
do i have diabetes or not&hellip; my doctor said because my a1c was a 9.4, that means i definitely do have type 2, but after reading many reports from the ada and other medical sites, its clear that using the a1c test to diagnose diabetes is not conclusive
an a1c of over 5.7 is considered diabetic
to have an a1c in the 9&#39;s your numbers must have been rather high
a1c of 9.4 is extremely high
my a1c for the last 9 months has never been over 5.3 and i definitely have type 2
oral glucose tolerance test =) your 9.4 a1c and any post-meal bg  of 140+ indicates that your body does not metabolize glucose normally
at that time i had an a1c of 6.5%   praying for success in your weight loss
he exercises everyday and has managed to keep his a1c at 5.0 for the past 20 years
i've kept my a1c at 5.3 and 5.4 for nearly 6 yrs
i've kept my a1c perfect for 3yrs now, i am on meds since i only have a part of my pancreas but i watch what i eat, stay active
my low was getting an a1c back at 6.6
i eat my burgers with a fork and knife (i have graduated to steaks recently where one does not need bread) i have been able to keep my bg (blood glucose) levels in the 80 to 130 mg/dl range, had achieved an a1c of 5.5% and lost 65 lbs over the course of 5 mo
and, when first diagnosed, my bg (645) and a1c (12.46) were both so high that i was immediately put on metformin and insulin injections
current a1c is 5.7 and bg stays pretty close to normal with the exception of breakfast (cereal, you know - but i had to eliminate eggs and breakfast meats due to cholesterol issues)
good news: since i have been on dc my a1c has dropped from 12.6 to 9.3
remember the a1c is a 3 month average of your blood sugar
my a1c was 9.6 when dignosed and i changed my diet and lowered it to 5.6 in 3 months
my a1c at diagnosis was 5.4 so i know it will be even lower than that this time
my last a1c was still 5.4 and i have been off metformin since some time in feb
i was able to wean myself off metformin by getting my a1c down to 5.6
achieved an a1c of 5.5% at one point (currently 6.1%)
my last a1c was 7.5
=f2xhliiuezy if i may &hellip; you might want to revisit the "carbs don't cause my sugars to skyrocket", given your 7.5 a1c and 294 bgl
when i was first brought to the hospital (by a friend because my mom thought i was either pretending to be sick or was just over dramatic about a common cold) my blood sugar was at 951, and my a1c was 14.8%
i just went in for my first 3 month check up and my a1c was 6.4
awesome job on getting your a1c down to 6.4
tml english my hba1c is high right now&hellip; 11.3% and ive seen the at home kits to test yourself
the god new is i was taken off metformin over a year ago and my bloog glucose numbers are in the mid 90's and my a1c is 4.9
i eat right and my a1c right before surgery was 6.4 and was a result of all my hard work
my last a1c was 6.6 in june&hellip;the two before that were over 7
i was able to lower my a1c from a 13.7 down to a 7.5
you see if my a1c  was as good as yours, than i' be almost @ the finishing line, where the prize 4 me would be this elective surgery that i want to get
lou well t1lou~~ i need to get my a1c below 5
here are the values noted on my lab work showing expected a1c ranges:   4.1% - 6.4%  non-diabetic children (1.5 to 18 years); 4.3% - 6.0% non-diabetic adults;  6.2% - 7.0% diabetic well controlled;  7.0% - 8.0% diabetic fair controlled;  &gt;8% diabetic poor control i'm perplexed
and my ins says if your a diabetic, and want a certain type of surgery &amp; you're a diabetic the a1c has to be lower than a 5
i wonder if the ada legislation would give you a cause of action against your insurer for this, particularly if you get your a1c into the high fives or low 6's
the thing that i don't have down, is getting my a1c under the magical number of 5
my a1c is only 6.1-6.3 most times, but it's the spikes when i'm sick that put me over the top
this was the only time i've actually took care of myself i even had my a1c's at 5.3 my entire pregnancy
if you are interested i can share with you what i did to practically normalize my blood glucose (bg) levels, bring my a1c down from the mid to low 6s to 5.5 plus lose approx 65 lbs in about 5 months
my a1c today was 5.4, a tad bit higher than my last one, but not significantly
in just over a year i have gone from an a1c of 14 down to 5.4 and a weight loss of about 125lbs
a1c from 14 to 5.4, that's excellent
i have the anxiety under contro now just need to bring the a1c down below 7.0
i'm now on an insulin pump and my last a1c was 7.5
when i was in high school, my a1c got up to 14%
right now my a1c is 6.9% and i stay fairly active
i can't remeber an a1c under 7.5
my latest blood work is good for my blood sugar - a1c is 6 but now my cholesterol is high and my doctor wants to put me on medication (currently take metformin)
by the time my a1c was down to 6.5, my cholesterol was also in very good shape and i was taken off the medication for cholesterol
my last 12 a1c's have been 4.9 to 5.4
the doctor said my a1c was "off the chart", and the chart only went to 15 - that scared the crap out of me
i manage to keep my bg (blood glucose) levels in the 80 to 130 mg/dl range and currently have an a1c in the very low 6% range
my a1c is 6.5 but i sometimes take more insulin to keep that
a1c was 4.6
my a1c went from 9 to 7
my a1c hasn't gone under 7.8 in years
y last a1c was 5.5 itch was good but for no we r just gonna keep a close eye on it becouse my numbers still run high alot
i had a new a1c a few days before christmas and it is now 5.4 which is great
these are my goals for the coming year; to keep my cholesterol down (it tends to fluctuate), get my a1c below 5.7 and (hopefully) be off metformin sometime during 2015
my a1c had been in the range 5.4-6.0 for many years, but i still had these complications
my last a1c was 6.8 but my goal is to get it back into the low 6's
i've resisted the pump, but do check often and have always managed an a1c in the 6's
my a1c is 6.1   robinlee oh
my a1c has been at 5.9-6.2 for the last 10 years
my a1c went from 14.1 to 5.9 in only a few months
so now i can't control my diabetes without meds like i used too and my a1c went up to 7 for the first time
my endocrinologist was skeptical that i could have good results with using the novolin in my pump, but after seeing my last a1c (6.6) and seeing that i have no more than a 20 point swing in my glucose readings (i test about 6 times a day) he was thoroughly convinced that the novolin was doing the job
i was seeing my primary for several years recently, having a1cs checked quarterly to manage my treatment, but one visit to an endo resulted in the discovery that i was overdosing my lantus by ~8 units for the entire time i was under treatment with the primary
i've chalked it up to a factor of aging (i'm 65) since my bp is good, my last a1c was 6.6 and i stay active
blood tests revealed that i was anemic also and take prescription iron pills 3 times a day and my energy level has gone way up, my a1c is better now then it ever has been at 5.3 with blood sugars ranging between 95 and 115 a far cry from the high 100 hundreds i use to get and my high blood pressure is no more
dr took me off avadamet (the one taken off the market) a few months before it was recalled, and put me on 45mg actos (am) and 500 metformin (am and after dinner) and my a1c's are usually 6.5 or lower, one month 5.8
my a1c on 8/7 was 7.0
my a1c is high, at a bad 12.9 ( i know, but i'm in that denial/ busy stage in the disease, please understand) and though i wonder if this is the cause he has asked me to lose the weight, it still seems a really drastic change to me
my a1c has come down from over 12 down to 6.0
heidi by reducing my daily carbohydrate intake, i have been able to maintain my weight around 120 pounds and keep my hba1c in the 6's
i've lost 49 pounds in seven months and in the first three months my a1c went from 8.2 to 5.8
my last a1c had went from 11 down to 8.1  i hope the holidays didn't elevate it again
hey guys my diabetic educator said cinnamon good for me i take just 2 a day in the morning 1000 mg, with my insulin 52 units a day and fish oil pills my a1c dropped 2 pts, down to 7.6 and 10 weight lost ,you all have great day hello set apart, i will not try cinnamon supplements
the results are steady and my a1c is 6
i have tried other meters but they were so far off on numbers i had one check up that floored me with my a1c until i realized the meter i was using was totally inaccurate by about 30 or more points every time i used it
right now, my a1c1 is 6.2 i use the omnipod glucose monotoring sytem
for the most part (except for a few reading in the 7's), my a1c's have been in the 6's which indicates good diabetes control
my a1c was 6.2 in oct 2013 and i have been off of meds for over a year, it took a few tries in the beginning to find the right combo of meds for me, and then again as i lost weight and my numbers got better, and then again when i finally said, "ok, what do i have to do to get off meds all together
in june my a1c was 5.8 with a fasting of 91, on 850mg of metformin daily and running 3 miles per day
my numbers are now a1c of 6.0 and 121 fasting with carbs and 110 without carbs
my a1c when last taken was 7.4 which is down and i was patting myself on the back
in addition, they want your a1c to be at a 6.0 or lower, and you have to visit your endo every month for blood work
he hasn't gotten it completely under control, but my a1c has gone from 13.7 to 6.9, so i am doing much better
just wanted to let you all know that i'm still kicking around&hellip;:o) oh, and btw&hellip;i've got my a1c down to 6.7 too
so good to hear from and congrats on losing 22lbs, and a1c 6.7
huh &hellip; must be a failure at this &hellip; 8 years since diagnosis 7 1/2 years a1c of 6.1 or lower &hellip; multiple complications &hellip; this has only motivated me to try harder failure
my a1c has kept under 6 so they just tell me to continue my present diet
last a1c just last week was 5.9
all the articles you reference are helpful, but i focus on exercise (treadmill) and keeping the a1c below 7
it estimates a1c over 3 months also - charts and all kinds of stuff
he is now getting regular medical care and taking care of himself (his last a1c was 6.1)
my current concerns:  * very poor control; most recent hba1c (7/2/2013) was an 8.6 (my worst ever); * extreme fatigue (worse than usual); and, * weight loss without any obvious cause (currently weigh 93 lbs
i started using it 2 months ago, and my a1c levels went down from 7,2 to 5,7
my doctor doesn't want to put me on one but my a1c last time was 9.7 which was down from 12.8 when i was in the hospital with dka
started at a1c of 6.6 and my recent (4 days back) a1c is 5.4
watching this has brought my a1c level down from 9.8 to 7.5
i was offically diagnosed on 5/21/10, my sugar had been high for a while but i had no insurance for all the blood work, suffice it to say my a1c was 10.8 at diagnosis, it's come down a bit but not enough
i take both basal and novolog to control my bs and finally went to the doctor last month and my a1c was down almost 2 points
not only did my morning glucose reading drop to an appropriate level, my a1c is 6.2 steve:  my a1c is 5.7, but i am trying to get my readings as low as possible while remaining stable within a rather narrow range
since your average bg is not 24/7/90days (like an a1c would be) it could only be an estimated a1c because not all the data is included
the closest to your 145 on that chart is a 154 which averages out to a1c of 7
an a1c count is an overall test of the last 3-4 months
takes my a1c every 3 months
good result on your last a1c - 5.6 is great
i too have mine taken every 3 months, last test result was 5.9 ~  i have kept my a1c under 6.0 for over ten years, with the exception of 2 times, once after being in rehab &amp; hospitals for 4 months~ it went up to 6.9, and another time it was 5.7 in sept
my a1c had jumped to 6.4
camerashy &hellip; at my last  appointment, with new endo, on dec.23 - she has told me that my a1c's  (always  from 5.2 to 5.9) ~ is under too good control
so now my goal is to raise my a1c to 7.0
but after an illness this past summer, my sugars are all over the place, my last a1c was 6.3, that was back in october
normal values are just a base point to start, they are so much more than just numbers to go by&hellip; isn't normal a1c between 4% and 5.6%
seriously, if i were you i would set my goal at an a1c of below 7&hellip;just keep it at that
doctor said as long as my a1c keeps coming back under 6, i don't have to test, but i still do, cuz i like to know what my limits are
when i finally got back under a doctors care, i had an a1c of 12.9 which they say is an average of 240
after 4 months of being on it, my a1c dropped ever so slightly from 6.5 to 6.2
i am trying to work on a1c which was 6.6 early dec
at that time my a1c was 303
most docs want us below 7 on the a1c, some below 6
ok, maybe i can help just a little here, an a1c is a 3 month test average of your bg, typically they say less than 7%, a good fasting is 70-130, a good 2hr after meal is less than 140, now these guidelines come from the american diabetes association, and there is also the american association of clinical endocrinologists which follows a slightly different scale&hellip;good fasting is less than 110, good 2 hr after meal is under 140, and a1c  &lt;6.5%, so, in short, it really depends on what scale your doctor who monitors your diabetes follows
ago blood sugar was 1089 with a 12.5 a1c after 3 mo
sorry i meant 1089was my blood sugar level i am type 2 ,i am sorry i do not know how to type i am trying  but it is hard to teach a old dog a new trick ok thanks, mine was over 800 when i was diagnosed with a1c over 11.0%, i remember how i felt and was trying to figure out how anyone would even be alive with a reading over 10,000 lol, we all goof here with our typo's no worries was just double checking lol you were at 800 when you were first diagnosed
ou also need to get your a1c tested,that will help you know if your overall blood sugars for 3 months have been good
(a1c was 5.6, non fasting glucose was 66)
thank you&hellip;darlene check your kidneys sorry for you troubles darly :(   a1c of 5.6 is very good though
as proof of my success my a1c's have been 6.2 for more than a year
my a1c went from 14.1 to 5.9 in four months by testing what i eat
my a1c was no higher than 6.5 when i first noticed it
quickly informed me that for my first a1c that was good and my goal is 7
started off slowly fitting that in when i first found out and i have now dropped 45 pounds and my a1c is down to 5.9 keep up the good work hun
i went for a follow up for the my a1c count is 4.8 and has declared me diabetes free
my sugars are out of control, my a1c is 13, i always wake up around 200 maybe even 300, for the last 2 weeks i've been fighting keytones &amp; going to the hospital
my a1c was 5.5-5.6
my a1c was only .8 above what they want a diabetic to be
when i was diagnosed, my fasting bg was 388, my a1c was 13.2 and i weighed 304.5 pounds
fast-forward six months:  (okay, seven and a half months, actually, but six months is my most-recent a1c reading)   i weighed in last week at my doctor's office at 220 even
my a1c is down to 4.7   my energy has dramatically increased
fasting : 105 mg/dl pp2 : 98 mg/dl hba1c: 6.1%   my historical results of hba1c are: sep-2014 - 10.3% nov-2014 - 7.2% dec-2014 - 6.5% jan-2015 - 6.1% feb-2015 - 5.7% april -2015 - 6.0% may -2015 - 6.1%   regards, you're doing a wonderful job:)  keep it up
my current a1c is 6.2% which is up from a 5.5% about 1 yr ago
any given a1c can be off by as much as  .5   &hellip;so what i am seeing is a "consistent range" in your a1c&hellip;and a pretty darn good range as well&hellip;i wouldn't be concerned as long as you are happy with the range you are in&hellip;me i am never happy (grin)&hellip;because my happy zone is normal and i wont be happy until i am consistently in the 4's&hellip;but most people aren't like me&hellip;i say cheers and continue doing what you are doing&hellip;and don't become concerned unless you break that .5 barrier on the wrong side of 6.3 or 6.4&hellip;because that would mean a real increase in a1c&hellip;not a bad increase
last year in sep-14, i came to know my hba1c level (10.3%) and i changed my lifestyle and diet
thereafter my hba1c reduced to 5.7%, but suddenly it is going up even last result is 6.1%
i have always controlled my diabetes &hellip; better than most type 2's i would venture, having kept my a1c at or below 6.1 for the past 7 1/2 years (diagnosed 8 years ago), but that hasn't stopped complications
his a1c was 6.7 the last time he went in &amp; he now only has to take his blood sugar 2 x a day &amp; is on metformin hc 500 mg 2 times a day
my a1c is between 6.3 &amp; 6.7
my a1c is 5.73, my fasting blood sugar is 106, my weight loss is 16 pounds, started at 314 am now 298
this exploding occurs when one's a1c is over 7, at the time i was at 10.6
in the next visit i had lowered my a1c to 6.8, and was told that things in my eyes were much better
17571-question-a1c-change-and-trygliceride-change-in-just-about-2-weeks
my a1c went from 6.0 to 5.9 tryglicerides from 275 to 264   i have been exercising way more but is this kind of change possible so fast
turtle looking at your a1c (only) your a1c is  "not influenced by daily fluctuations in the blood glucose concentration but reflect the average glucose levels over the prior six to eight weeks" ~  http://www
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
my a1c has remained below 6 for 2 years now
during past year my a1c climbed into the 7's
my doctor says it ain't so, but i've found from blood tests that the higher my triglycerides, the higher my a1c, even when my hdl &amp; ldl are normal; if my triglycerides are up, so is my a1c
12704-a1c-how-i-got-it-to-5-4
last check was july a1c 5.3
my a1c was 7.4 and i micro manage my meals and i exercise 2 hour a day  six days a week and drink lots of water
ty my last a1c over a year ago, was 5.4 i know i need to get it checked soon, and i am sure it is still in good range
my may a1c was 5.5
yes you will build better log house for your self have fun with it it will be a new start  new start are fun best of all you can do it your way just got good news from my doctor, my a1c was a 5.5, six months ago it was 6.0
good job congrats on your a1c&hellip;that's great&hellip; thank you good job it feels great dosen't it feels great, triglycerides went from 100 to 71 and cholesterol went from 160 to 147
hi kaiya2465&hellip;to simplify, a1c is the average of your bg readings over a 3  to 4 month period
gabby: i remember that chart but it is just as confusing for me&hellip;last a1c was 5.3 bs was 97
by my calculations, if 97 was your average your a1c should be around 4.8
a 5.3 a1c would work out to an average bg of 112
i'm a brittle diabetic, so, for example, every time my a1c was 5.9, i tracked back my very unstable numbers, and in my case they were approximately on any given day:  350, 58, 600, 300, 220, 50, 68, 90, 50, 500&hellip;so, the a1c means very little to me&hellip;sorry to sound so hostile, no offense meant to anybody, but that a1c is not a good measurement in my case, as every day my numbers change so quickly and rapidly, that that darned average makes it look as though i am in excellent health&hellip;makes me very very mad, frustrated beyond belief&hellip;i am sick and tired of nurses that glance at my a1c and say " oh&hellip;hardly anything wrong with you
every time i see a doctor now ( still looking for a new endo and am getting closer), i have to bend over backwards and then some more to get them to see an a1c of 5.9 for me doesn't mean that everyday i consistently had a blood sugar of 126
before seeing him i would say my average bg was around 150-160 and the last time i had my a1c checked was in september last year at 6.2
your hba1c won't be affected much by this late change since it tracks the past 2 to 3 months of bg's
tml english all my blood work came back good, my a1c is 5.3
(women they want it over 50) and bad cholesterol is at 78 (women they want under 100) my last a1c is at 5.9 but will be up again due to steroid use again, had an allergic reaction to antibiotics
if you think about a non-diabetic child, they will have lower a1cs and lower bg levels so it's not really that a lower a1c is bad, it's the way you get it that's important
i know when my son was doing really well and had an a1c around 6, his doc&#39;s first question was always about lows
we just had a1c of 6.7 and 7.1 and were happy with that
my a1c was up just a tiny bit from 5.3 to 5.4
i can't wait to get my a1c below 6
my a1c was 6.3 so that also went down a little
i also got off my nph injections and normalized my blood glucose (bg) levels and achieved an a1c of 5.5
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
my a1c in the hospital was 11.5
since the hba1c (glycosylated hemoglobin) test is a measure of the percentage of red blood cells that have glucose stuck to them and indicates the overall average blood sugar level over the past 2 to 3 months, your fasting (or nonfasting) status when the blood was drawn should not make a difference
for type 1's, a1c's in the 6's indicate good control
i fly for the military, and the doctors are looking to give me another 3-4 months to get my a1c closer to being under 7 for me to be able to remain in the military
the problem is with her auto-immune failure antibodies are attacking her pancreas, they ran so many tests today 10 vials of blood were drawn for testing for so many different things, a1c was 12.6, she had glucose in her urine, the skin tags under her arms that recently developed is caused by too much insulin in her body we were told, she is considered obese due to the weight she's at vs
tml english i'm so excited went to the doctors this afternoon and my a1c is 5.3
send message if want to discuss individual machines and/or contacts i learned to manage my diabetes which in turned lowered my a1c it is still hovering at 6.5 as of last week
i still haven't had a new a1c test as i am hoping that my next one will be better than the 9+ it has been for the past 20 years
i still haven't had a new a1c test as i am hoping that my next one will be better than the 9+ it has been for the past 20 years
my last a1c was 6.8 and i'm trying to improve on that
not sure there is anything "fast" about diabetes &hellip; in fact i would be very leery of anything that claims to quickly lower your a1c   namaste -steve i totally agree;-) i'm a t2 hypoglycemic and its not fun my bs's constantly go way low and then way high and back to normal it's a pain riding this rollercoaster ride;-( howdy ashlyn i know of no way of lowering one's a1c other than keeping one's blood glucose (bg) at a good level   there may be a way of affecting the a1c, but going hypo frequently is not recommended as it is quite dangerous to you
a1c was 12.8 2 years ago at diagnosis
a1c was 7.7, amylase was elevated, lipase was elevated, as were white blood cells
a couple months ago, i went to the doctor and my a1c was 13
as i myself did, my a1c was 14 for a long time
i just got back from the doctor and my a1c is down to 10.3
my a1c is at 13 as well, i haven't taken care of myself in so long i'm having to relearn how to carb count and adjust my ratios
what helped me get through this was i thought about my future and where i hope to be when i'm in my 30s and hopes i can have a child and a family of my own, it's easy to ignore the disease and go on with your life, but we can't ignore it forever exp when later on down the road complications may be a factor and then we really can't ignore it, start to get the hang of it now it wil pay off in the long run, and you will feel better with lower a1c and boost your confidence when you go in to your drs and they are excited about your a1c it's all so worth it
my numbers look great, a1c adverage is 5.6
my a1c is 5.5, and i've lost 50 pounds
tml english does anyone else get a little anxious prior to labs, i so hope i have done as good as i think i have will know tomorrow linda oh no  i have been  gone for awhile, now i have to relearn  the new format  here for discussions, i have not posted for awhile  my a1c was not bad at all 7.3    linda i get anxious to see my results then again i'm new to all of this
after diagnosed, my a1c has not been higher than 5.7
i was diagnosed in october with at a1c of 11
i did however, manage to get my a1c down to 7.6, which was a huge improvement
my last a1c was 6.2
my last a1c was 5.1
i have had my sight get worse when my bs was high for some time a1c 11+ but never anything like you are descibing
my current a1c is 6.2, and has been around this level now for about 2 years
but the thing i'm selling is the need to control your blood glucose which is represented by an a1c in the 6's
all of my blood sugars are low and my a1c's since i went on the metformin, have been below 5.6; so its not a case of high blood sugars in my case
he had checked my thyroid on my first a1c test, but said that he would check it again on my 3rd a1c test in may
well i now have my a1c down to 7.1 and me and my husband really want to have a baby&hellip;anyone out there give me any adivce &hellip;the dr said i can have a heathy baby if hy sugers stay under controll but just wanted to talk with others that have been through it i have had 2 kids 5yrld and 4yrld
om/ for the most part it is working, my a1c is 5.3, no complications, thank god for that
i was also not put on medications when i was diagnosed and my first and only a1c was 6.4 which the doctor was happy with
my last a1c was 5.9
my latest hba1c report is 6.2 which could be better but i am happy with the results
according to this article, ideal numbers are &hellip; a1c &lt;5.3% fasting blood glucose &lt;86 mg/dl oggt / post-meal (mg/dl after 2 hours) &lt;120 mg/dl those are the numbers i'm shooting for
namaste steve although my last 3 a1c's have been in the "ideal" range, when i talked with my doctor this past week her comment to me was that i was running a bit on the lower than average side and that anything below 7 was considered "good"
i've seen my fbg slowly increasing and i do not see another a1c for 6 months
they may well be unattainable for me as well &hellip; i have been working towards 5.6 for over a year now and have decreased my a1c to 5.7 so i really needed to "raise the bar" ( or lower it &hellip; depending on how you see it) it would be nice to get to those numbers, but it won't break my heart if i don't (i think there may be a morbid pun there) i will be delighted if i ever manage to get mine below 6
a1c's of 6.1, 6.2
tml english i been testing my sugar been high 225 to 300 so just got a1c tests back it was 7.0 not what i exspected thought would be higher
what good reading for a1c a 7.0 a1c is considered "fair" control for a diabetic
a1c's in the 6's are considered "good" control for someone with diabetes
a1c went from 14.1 to 5.9 in less than 4 months
a1c has remained at 6 or less for over 3 years now
i weigh 210 i am 5'6, i want to lose weight and do my best to bring down my a1c it's great that you're taking the first step by being honest with yourself about diabetes, and that you're thinking about possible changes you can make to reach your goals of weight loss and lowering your a1c
i was able to discontinue my twice daily injections of nph insulin, keep my bg (blood glucose) levels in the "normal" range (80 ti 130 mg/dl), achieve an a1c of 5.5 and lost 65 lbs over the course of 5 mo
i just went to the doc on thurs apr 12 and my a1c was down from 8.5 to 7.4 so something is working lol
more then likely, your doctors will check your a1c which is a 3 month average of your blood glucose
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
my a1c has remained below 6 for 2 years now
my a1c was under 6, my cholesterol was under 150, the "good" was in the 60s the bad was in the 60s and my diet was good and i rode my nike 5 miles every day
i am not sure about the site changes because with the pump we are only doing 2 to 2 1/2 days per site-i have heard that the combo of pump and cgms is wonderful and we have seen a change in a1c from 8.1 to 7.5 with only 30 days on the pump&hellip;good luck with the comfort issue we have heard the silhoute (sp) is an angled site and offers more comfort in areas that have a little less fat
i'm trying to get my hba1c down to 6.5% so i can maybe think about having a third baby (i'm a gluten for punishment)
as a type 2 my goal is an a1c &lt; 5.7, fasting bgl &lt; 100, 2 hour postprandial bgl &lt; 120 &hellip; be off all diabetes medication, and avoid any further complications
my last a1c was 6.8 and i expect the one in july will be lower
congratulations on your lowering of your a1c to 6.3 (i am taking for granted that is what you are telling me)   i have downloaded the pdf file and have started to read it, but   it is late for me and i need to go to bed &mdash;- long day
my a1c was 8.4
i was on 500 mg of metformin last sept with a a1c of 11 and now on janiva with an a1c of 5.1
i try to eat around same time, to keep some control last a1c was 7.9 trying to drop them back down, i have very stressful job so that good control for me, i eat lot of fish turkey burgers , veggies, and the arnold round bread, doing pretty good, wish you luck this may be a touchy subject but i work at a human service office
not sure if this has been adopted yet but an a1c of 6.5 or above has been recommended as a new diagnostic criteria
my a1c went from a 7.1 to 8.1 i thought it was going to be worse
james i've been dealing with foot infection for three years that was probably caused by past frostbite during that time i've had several a1c tests and been evaluated for diabetes without a diagnosis until last week i was infection free since 9/2011 i have recently been admited and my a1c came back as diabetic i wonder if the almost constant antiboitic treatment for the last year could be the cause i was diagnosed after a toe infection that had been intermittant for three years, had antibiotics every 6-9 months for it, and, at the end, had a bad 3 month infection
my glucose was 238, a1c was 10.1 and bp was 160/104
my a1c went up to 7.6 and i am just now getting it back to 6.7 today
its been 3 years and 2 endos and still uncontrolled just had labs done on thurs a1c was 12.6 down from 12.7 in november and i'm starting to have signs that my kidneys are failing excess protein and sugar in urrine

recent a1c was 7.4
recent a1c was 7.4

i am able to keep my hba1c in the 6's by limiting my carbs to 120 total grams per day: 30 for breakfast and 45 each for lunch and dinner
as soon as i went on bp meds the headaches went away and my initial a1c of 6.5 came down to 5.7
and triglycerides are 458, and hba1c is 6.5
ada recommends hba1c to be under 7, which mine is
now i can eat them and maintain a a1c under 5 without meds&hellip;i even ate a banana with my afternoon meal today&hellip;yay me
at my heaviest i was 325 pounds with a bmi of 44.1 a1c of 10.0
at my thinnest i was 158, bmi - 21.4 a1c - 6.1

he relayed my numbers back to me daily bg 100-110, a1c 5.5, liver and kidney functions normal, vitals all good, and i've lost nearly 60lbs
multi vitamin   results:  5.5 and 5.6 a1c however, for more variety, i'm switching to an anti inflamatory diet with omega 3 and vit d supplementation per toma grubb's web site
i had not eaten anything for 10 hrs before and that my a1c level was at 10
the crazy thing is my a1c runs 5.7 to 6.2 all the time yeppie hurrary and thank the powers that be my byrdreon seems to finally be kicking in it has taken 5 weeks and along with the lantus i am taking at bed time most of my sugars are now under 170 and going down i am begining to feel human again
regarding your a1c, you are aware that an a1c is an average figure of your blood glucose (bg) levels over the past 90 days
so you can have a high bg with a lower a1c only if you have lows (hypos) which affects your total average of your a1cs by offsetting your highs
a1c 6.1 (down from 6.4)
he wants me to get my a1c below 6
the ada suggests that "under the new recommendations, which are revised every year to reflect the most current available scientific research, an a1c of 5.7 &mdash; 6.4 percent would indicate that blood glucose levels were in the pre-diabetic range, meaning higher than normal but not yet high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes
that diagnosis would occur once levels rose to an a1c of 6.5 percent or higher
hi kec - i am new here :), but i wanted to post because i have been able to get my a1c down from the 8 range to the 5.3 to 6 range in a matter of months
i say this because to get it into the 5's which i never have reached watching carbs and being creative is the way to go howdy kec,   bringing your a1c down will take time, as it is the average of your blood glucose (bg) levels 24/7 for the past 90 days
as far as taking steps to actually bring a1c down i had achieved an a1c of 5.5 after about 3 months on the following eating plan ith which i experemented trying to manage my bg levels without the use of diabetes medications
i have been able to keep my bg levels in the neighborhood of 80 to 130 mg/dl achieve an a1c of 5.5%, lose 65 lbs over a 5 mo period all the while ditching my twice daily nph injections
a1c was 6.5 after the doctor changes my medication  she made so other changtes that haa brought my good cholestrol up 14 points
my a1c has gone down from almost 9 to 7.1, and i've lost enough weight to look and feel pretty good
lol yes &hellip; some of us are just really unlucky, i have maintained an a1c of 6.1 or less for over 7 years but have numerous complications &hellip; but you can increase your chances of staying healthy by eating low carb, exercising and maintaining an ideal weight (thereby improving your insulin sensitivity)   steve thanks, steve
which reminds me my last a1c check in july was 5.7 down from 6.6 so i must be doing something right
by the way&hellip;the american diabetes association will tell you you are "doing okay" if you maintain a a1c of 7.0 or less
an a1c of 7.0 translates to an average daily blood glucose of 154
i went, in six months, from an a1c of 13.2 to an a1c of 4.7 - i was in horrible shape
hi-i'm newly diagnosed, a1c at 381, but have been reading two very instrumental books on reversing diabetes
a1c 381
if that&#39;s what you&#39;re reporting here, your a1c would be right around 15% with an eag of 381
my a1c was 16%
my doctor kept emphasizing a1c so i thought that was the 381
my a1c dropped to its lowest number within 3 months
my last a1c was 6.7
i usually have fasting blood glucose (bg) readings below 130 and i had an a1c of 5.5 for the longest time (it is somewhere in the 6s now)
my a1c is now 6.5 and my total cholesterol is 107
tml english i'm a t2 diagnosed 4 years ago with an a1c of 13.7
y a1c was 14 i never want to go that high agan
having your a1c below 6.0 (nondiabetic level) and not having so many highs helps you avoid diabetic complications in you eyes, kidneys , heart, etc
thanks for the info believe it or not i have a nutritionist and when i asked her she kept skipping around the subject i usually eat less than 50 carbs per day no more then 100 if i am eating out my a1c was 14 and i have gotten it down to 8 by just changing the amount of carbs and bad foods that i was eatng
only problem is that now i have reached the point in my disease where i am on three oral anti-diabetics and controlling my diet, but my blood sugars are way out of control and i also have an a1c of 10
since i stated working with "the team" my a1c has went from an 11.8 to a 10.2 so far
:)   my goals are to get even healthier &mdash; in the last year my a1c has gone from 8.4 to 5.7
my a1c is 7.2
but just to update you, i do not have to test anymore&hellip;i am one of the lucky ones i guess &amp; actually back to where i should be for the last 2 months with my a1c which 5.2&hellip;i may not like some of the responses i may/may not get, like we all say&hellip;what works for some may not work for others
my last a1c was 6.2
my a1c was 5.9   then doctor was i had a problem
my last a1c was 9.2&mdash;-i am really struggling with trying to get it under control
tml english my doctor called said my a1c came back, she said it was 135 av of 5.96 she want's me to start meds metformin   should i see another doctor or does this sound right, i have been feeling like crud after a lot of sugar  please help hello there michael
according to the american diabetes association, a person who is diabetic is said to have an a1c of greater than 6.00%
my recent a1c was 5.3 so i am pretty well controlled, however i was curious what everyone thinks an ideal blood sugar is to have before bedtime- when i say bedtime i usually mean around 1am because i am a student and stay up late typically finishing homework
i use the plate method as well and i have what my doctor says is excellent control as my a1c runs between 5.8 and 6.2 for the last 20 years since i first got it under control after being diagnosed
have been diagnosed type 2&hellip;but last a1c i was down to prediabetic a1c level of 6.0&hellip; but have extreme insulin resistence reading of 340 (normal being 50-60)
my last a1c was 5.4
ok she just answered (we were texting back and forth) and said blood glucose as far as she knew but i would bet money on it that it was an a1c  just because that seems to be the test of choice in todays doctors and also because they drew a vile of blood not just a drop and they only did 1 draw, also because one can not rule out diabetes with 1 monitor reading
god bless :o) lori that's a good reason to be tested although genetics in diabetes is very complicated, especially because the different types have a completely different gene set, and a simple blood sugar and a1c test is not going to rule out type 1 forever, and maybe not even on the day it was taken
mine were way high 1051 and that why they told me i was headed for a stroke everything was normal except my a1c &amp; that was 7.9 plus i had a drop in bs and it scared me because my heart raced and i was sweating profusly &amp; i was shaking so badly i could bearly test my blood and felt like i couldn't stand or function
i had achieved an a1c of 5.5% and the first 5 mo i lost 65 lbs and had to add a little fat in to the meal plan to keep from losing too much weight
when i was on the pump before, my a1c went from the 8's (before pumping) to 5.7 (at it's highest point while on the pump)
i have gained better control since switching had last jan i reached my best a1c of 7.5 which is the most significant aspect of pump treatment
i have lowered my a1c by 6.7 points in 6 months, my triglycerides by 503 points
i had to call my dr office to get my results of the test i did 3 weeks ago and she said my a1c is 7.5 and my eag was 168
a1c is a test that gives an average of your blood glucose levels over the past 2 to 3 months
thankz lois a1c tests should be done every 3-6 months depending on your situation and control
im gonna go see a endocrinologist&hellip; i say im in control cause my a1c is 5.3 thanks for reply lee777
my a1c is 5.1 and kidneys are at about 25%
the first is my doctor said that my a1c was 11.3, what does this mean
sorry if this seems overwhelming but there are so many unanswered questions that the only answer i have to offer now is explaining what an a1c is, i can't begin to answer the others as i'm not your doctor but you need to be better informed on why they say your type 2 and what to do to control it, all of this should have been explained to you in much better detail then what you posted here, if it wasn't you need to contact this doctor and get the answers
to explain an a1c, it is a test that is done on the blood to give an average of what the blood glucose level has been for the past 3 months
with the a1c results you gave i understand them putting you on meds to control your diabetes but it still amazes me that they said you didn't need to test your blood glucose at home and keep a record, not going back for 2 months, you'll have no idea what your numbers are running while on the med, nor do you have a baseline of what your numbers are meter wise prior to starting the medication
for me, limiting my carbs to 120 grams per day has enabled me to maintain my weight at 120 lbs and my last a1c was 6.8
last a1c was 5.7
i have been doing that since feb 2011 and my a1c was 5.5 in may
my a1c was 8.4 in august
on that plan i have lowered my weight 65 lbs over a 5 mo period, achieved an a1c of 5.5%
i started a meal plan in 2011 which i partially follow to this day and with it i got off of my diabetes meds, lowered my a1c, and dropped 65 lbs within months
a1c is down to 6.7 and all other numbers improved
live for the number&hellip; a1c and bs &hellip; singingnurse93 here
it is extra work, and can be time consuming, but my last a1c was 5.8
i had a a1c of 9.4 not good whatsoever
the ha1c is a great barometer for letting you know what your blood sugars have been for the last 3 months
while taking a finger stick reading will vary depending on when you last ate and what you ate, the ha1c goes directly to your red blood cells (which live about 120 days or 3 months)
when my a1c wouldn't go down enough my doctor doubled the dose to 1000 mg twice a day
my glucose was 93 non-fasting and my hba1c was 5.2, both within normal range
i have lost a lot of weight (actually it just came off as a result of eating properly rather than "dieting" per se, i control this condition without medication and my a1c is always in the low 5's, which means i have "normal" blood sugars
my a1c stays around 4.5 every 6 months
tml english hey everyone i was laying in bed last night and come up with an idea for a meter one that test blood glucose and blood ketones and do an a1c test like a 3 in 1 meter do think any of us diabetics who go for it name the company who you think would be most likely make it and what should it be called any thoughts
abbott  freestyle neo does and there the nova max plus both these meter can test for blood ketones and i agree that one strip would be great for testing all three now would this be a meter that takes all three at the same time or would you program it for each individual test (as for ketones, i just use the strips if and when i do test) also the a1c test that i get at wallies is only $25 or so for two tests, one i do when i get my regular blood work done (and they come in pretty close) and the second is just to check where i'm at occasionally   again great idea, the convenience would be great, it's the piddly details and the fact that big pharma would design and market it that makes me go mmmmm   ~t i was thinking one strip and three buttons you would press the button for the test you want it's an interesting idea but not something i think i would use
my average bg runs about 150 right now with my last hba1c at 6.9
since a1c's are a measure of bg control over the past 2 or 3 months, having that reading 8 times a day would be wasteful for me
officially diagnosed a week later with fasting sugar level of 450 and a a1c of 13.7
3 months later i now average a 116 glucose level, have lowered my a1c to 6.5, and am doing a heck of a lot better
n the last 9 months i have lost 45 lbs and last 3 a1c have been 5.4 alan can i call you a control freak
my bg is 300 a1c is back up to 8.0 now bp was 120/80 pulse was 80 and cholosterol was almost back upto 300 the bad kind
i'm at 500mg and suppsoed to take it twice a day, i'll have to call my new doctor and ask her if i should be taking less or only one pill in the evening like you my diagnosed a1c was 13.0 i had to check that and my bgl was 326 and my doctor started me on 500 mgs metformin the same day
my second a1c was 9.5 and it was lower each time
he said his last a1c was 5.9
my a1c was 5.7 a month ago also, i know how you feel
yep, i have been in pretty tight control&hellip;my a1c's , 4 times a yr
between my diet and exercise, and yes, my januvia and insulin, my a1c was 5.6 a few weeks ago
the best a1c test i have ever had was 7.2 but usually are from 7.9-8.9
my a1c is down to 6.3%
i've only had type @ for about 7 months and my a1c is 5.4, i test a lot and watch what i eat
i thank god my a1c has went from 8.9 to 6.1 can you let me know if diabetics are suppose to go to dentist i truly can't afford to go to one and i need to bad the medications for ra has caused me very thin bones and messed with my teeth so bad and before the medication i had perfect teeth not one cavity either plus gained 140 pounds praise god i was loosing but now hypothyroidism gaining again i'm always fighting a health issue, but god helps me daily
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
my a1c two weeks ago was 7.3
at my last checkup ,my thyroid level was down and he increased my meds,but my a1c was had increasedto 8.3,so he again adjusted my meds
mary well as for my a1c it was 8.9 and i am going to have the test done again at the end of the month
i have maintained a normal bg level most of the time, and my last a1c is 5.5 in may
of course this was also during my 3-month follow up and my a1c was down considerably, so he said the a1c was the true indicator of how well my control is more-so than a single reading or a series of fasting readings
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
tml english just wanted to share some good news: my a1c has dropped .4 points to 6.8

thank you for your reply   my fasting bg is now 96 mg/dl insuline: 2,43 miu/l hemoglobine a1c%: 3,86 % c-peptide: 0,71 ng/ml (there is a "-" between it and written that the reference would be between: 0,78-5,19) thank you john and type1lou for your replies
i was able to discontinue my twice daily injections of nph insulin (i know as a t 1 you can't do that) all the while maintaining a bg (blood glucose) level of 8o0 to 130 mg/dl, and achieved an a1c of 5.5% and lost 65 lbs over a 5 mo period
i have been taking that for 4 months now and my a1c is down to 7.2 and in oct , of last year it 14.9 plus my blood sugars have been running pretty to normal as well at 85 to 130 some times the foods we eat contain sugar or sugar subsidies which are worst than sugar
i know the feeling might want to try adding chromium to your diet i take this 200mg of it a day and my levels have improved greatrly , and my a1c test yesterday came back as 7.2  , you haven't told us exactly what you already do, or have tried, to lower your glucose
my 14 day avg is &hellip;300 my hem a1c is 10.1   am i a responsible diabetic
with this kind of control i have an a1c of 5.6 and i have no diabetes complications after 64 years of type 1

i've lost 70lbs, my a1c is 5.6, got my lisinopril dosage (for kidneys) lowered, got my bp &amp; cholesterol down, quit smoking, &amp; best of all&hellip; i changed my outlook on life
it would also give an a1c below 6.0 which is excellent
i am in that range about 85% of the time and my a1c is 5.6
my a1c went down to 6.8 from 7.9 and my dr is very happy with me i tryid very hare to do this
my a1c was 14.3, but currently my numbers have drastically decreased
as i said below, unless your a1c is around 4.7-5.2 or so, you would benefit from taking some after meal readings because i guarantee you will see high numbers, maybe in the 200-300 range that's  right  kd  your  readings  will  be  high  right  after  you  eat,  so  that  would  be  useless  to  check  your  b/s  amediately  after  you  eat,  so  you  should  wait  to  about  3  hours  and  then  check  it,  so  if  it  is  high,  then  cut  back  on  your  carbs,  if  it's  low,  then  eat  a  little  bit  of  ice  cream  or  some  graham  crackers  or  sort  to  bring  it  back  up,  then  maybe  you  can  check  it  again  just  to  be  on  the  safe  side  to  see  what  your  reading  is  then  you  can  work  with  it  from  there
with the numbers that you claim to have when you test you're a1c should be around the 4.7-5.2 range
my a1c is 5.9%
unless your a1c is around 4.7-5.2 or so, that's likely happening to you
109 is bad,,,y oh  sorry  my  bad  i  see  now  what  you  are  saying  no  109  is  good,  depending  on  your  weight,  to  me  i  weigh  175,  and  my  a1c's  are  reading  good  and  my  blood  pressure  is  good  and  cholestrol  is  low  so  yes  109  is  great' why  is  109  bad  nzingha
my last a1c was 6.7
i managed to keep my blood glucose (bg) within the normal range, had an a1c of 5.5 and lost about 65 lbs in 5 mo
my bg levels are generally in the normal range, my may a1c was 5.5 and i have lost about 50 lbs on that eating plan
i have kept my bg (blood glucose) levels at a "normal" (80 to 130 mg/dl) and had an a1c of 5.5% for quite some time, and lost 65 lbs over a 5 mo period all the while not using any diabetes medications
i have good a1c's 6.4
my doctor took me off of my diabetes med (metformin) as i had an a1c of 5.5
he wants to retest my a1c in 3 months so see if my numbers remain
i got my test results today and my latest a1c was 5.4
if he's checking a1c once a month, it would seem a waste of an expensive test, because a1c is a moving average of your bg readings over a 90 day period
this is by no means an exact diabetic menu but it works for me and my a1c and daily blood sugars are down from starting about 4 months ago&hellip;and i'm losing some weight eating it
tml english dxed qith hga1c of 13 on 2013 at age 27
the hba1c covers a time frame of the last 3 months so, you've had diabetes at least 3 months and most likely longer
my sugars have remained stable and my a1c has not been this low in 4 years
so they put me on low dose insulin an my a1c is under 7 are you doing any type of diet control
now they will watch my levels and a1c and probably put me on some kind of shot i would take 2x's a month
his last a1c was 10.3
my a1c was 7.7, started bydureon and the next one in april was 6.1
her bs could be border line say 105  but her ha1c is 9.8 this is a red flag that she might be having or is a borderline diabetic, hope that helps knowing is half the battle, action is the other half
however, with an a1c of 5.9 she is pre diabetic but at 11, why would this not be considered a problem
like you i also eat some of the things on that list, in moderation, and like you my a1c stays in acceptable / good levels and my blood sugar levels stay in perfect range for my 3 month check up
my last a1c's were 5.6 &amp; 6.2
when i first got diagnosed, my a1c was near 13&hellip;as soon as i got on my meds (pills and insulin) my next test was 6.5
when i went to the doc he say that my a1c is at 8.5 if your a1c is 8.5 then it's possible that you are having higher blood sugar than 140 at some point during the day, or it may be the 400s tailing off
at the time my a1c was 11.0% and my glucose reading for that day was 300
i brought my a1c down to 6.7% and lost 32 lbs
my a1c was 13 when i bought his book and began following his direction
with that said, i was a diabetic whose a1c used to be 13.76, way above the supposedly correct levels for a diabetic type 2 individual
the reason for the high a1c is because my blood sugars were as high as 524 and never below 364
you are doing great if your a1c is 6.0 i am doing great if mine is 7
when i was dieting and using the treadmill my a1c was down to 6.0
my may 2011 a1c was 5.5, and i've lost about 50 lbs since i started this eating plan
14333-my-a1c-s-1980-2011
tml english i thought it might be interesting to some of you to see my a1c's starting in 1980
a1c testing was not available until 1976
my doc started a1c's with his patients in 1980
for the last 10 years, my a1c runs in the 6's
the truth is my a1c is always below 6.5 and my dr
it's nice to fantasize about not testing or having to inject insulin or count carbs and eat whatever you want&hellip;but you are doing a great job as your a1c shows&hellip;i'm trying to get mine back into the low 6's and will be starting the steps to go on the pump at the end of this month&hellip;a new chapter in my ever evolving life with diabetes
my a1c was 5.4 on my last visit but i know that it will not be that low this time, i don't  need to test to tell me that
my a1c was only 5.6 a whopping .2 points higher than it was last time and a huge 5.8 points lower than it was 9 months ago
wow, your a1c 5.6 is great&hellip;i know what you mean about stressing out about all this, i have my test at the end of sept&hellip;and here i am worrying about it&hellip;you just never know where you are going to be with this&hellip;take care&hellip; i am so glad your test were so good, and i know what you mean about wanting to do better and i am sure u will
pulling yourself up is hard&hellip;my a1c was 8.3 with average bg's high 300's
when my wife called to set up the appointment with the surgeron they asked her about my diabetes and my last a1c (which was 12.8) they told her that i will have to go and be admitted in the hospital at least a day before and after the surgery i will have to stay at least 5 days after
luckily, they were still able to accomplish it arthroscopicaly (though i looked like a gunshot victim), my a1c was 8 when i went in that morning and i was home by dinner
last wednesday i went to my primary care doctor for my a1c test and it came back 5.4
my a1c is 5.5
with me taking his advise the highest my a1c has been is 5.7   i admit i am blessed to have him treating me
i can't remeber an a1c under 7.5
to diagnose diabetes you would need 2 fasting tests of 126+, reading of over 200 on the oral glucose tolerance test, possibly an a1c of 6.5+ or a random reading of 200+ in addition to diabetic symptoms
pre-diabetes is fasting 110-125, 140-199 of the ogt or a1c of 6.0-6.4
my a1c is at 10
i ended up in the hospital last year, with an a1c of 13.5
my a1c is about a 9 right now
i don't buy into the load of crap that diabetes will get worse&hellip;in many cases (although i can not say all)&hellip;i started out on 2000 mg of metformin a day&hellip;i now take zero meds&hellip;and my a1c hovers around 5&hellip;my last one was in the 4's&hellip;diabetes is progressive because of the way the medical community treats it
i have achieved what control i have (a1c of 5.7) by eating &lt;50 total grams of carbs per day &hellip; exercising daily &hellip; and intermittent fasting
i have maintained my bg levels at or close to the "normal" range, (when i deviate from my meal plan i do pay with higher bg levels) my latest a1c was 5.5, and i have lost about 65 lbs since i started on my little experement in feb 2011
dan i actually eat 5 smaller meals a day with a few less carbs but you really need your dr cause your  sugars read different than the 3 meal way but my a1c is always 6 to 7.2 usually when i cheat on my plan well the quitting smoking didnt last i just keep trying lol my numbers have been good but this morning they were high but i had alot of junk food before bed i am trying i htink i am doing better but will have to try a little harder to stay away from bad snacks first of all ji'm type 1 diabetic and this is what i do i eat what ever i want i just stop eatting after eight o'clock at night and my sugar reading is most of the time down this everyday it is uselly 88 sometimes it is a little higher
type 2 (pwd) since 2009  a1c history over the past 9 months :     5.3 , 5.5 ,5.4 i look forward to the day too
my latest a1c from may is 5.5
i have lowered my  a1c from 9.2 to 5.8 since december
i am maintaining an a1c of 5.5&hellip;perfect
tml english my hemoglobin a1c is 6.2 and my fingersticks are normal
a non-diabetic a1c is 4.6-5.7
in the past different labs did have different scales and methods to do the a1c test but that's been pretty much standardized and although you will never get a test tat is 100% accurate, the same result in one lab will mean the same result in a different one
in the past month my a1c has gone from an 8.8 to a 9.2 despite following my diet and taking both victoza and invokana
i am having weight loss surgery and my a1c has to be at or under 8.0 to have the surgery
praying for better health for you   james well since a1c is an average of the past three months more emphasized on the last 8 weeks, i say no way to lower it quickly
my may a1c was 5.5, and even though i was not trying to lose weight, i lost about 50 lbs february through september
10168-hba1c-test-was-10-2
i'v had type2 for over 10 years with really good a1c of 5.5, and have always had hdl's between 50 & 70, even before becomming diabetic
i am a type 1 diabetic and have been for my whole life (30 years), and i would i have had it pretty well under control, the last a1c i had was 6.5
a1c in the 6's is perfect&mdash;no higher, no lower
i feel better than i have in 5 years and my a1c is below 7 again
tml english even my #'s are a little better today&hellip;but now i have a different question for you&hellip;how can it be that my a1c can be 5.9 if my daily #'s are so high
the time before last my a1c was 7.5 and this last time it was 6.0 and i couldn't understand that because i have had some higher bg numbers
that must be why my a1c was 6.0
the clinic i go to was going to put me on byetta if my a1c was 6.5 or higher to help my body use the sugar for energy and help my matabolism to increase so that i would lose weight
my late wife "jem" often had blood glucose (bg) levels of over 300, but during the same time frame had an a1c of 6
when i asked her endo about it he stated that since the a1c is an average she was undoubtedly having some pretty low lows to bring her a1c down like that
the a1c is an average of all your blood glucose values over about 3 months
my last a1c was 5.4, i can't seem to get it past that i would like to lower it more, so interested in anyone who has it lower than that, and what they eat, and if they take supplements
it has virtually eliminated the dangerous hypoglycemic episodes i'd been having and has enabled me to get my a1c back below 7.0
she had my last a1c score which was 9.4
my endo is happy with me at 6.9 but i want to get my a1c back into the mid-6's
there are a lot of diabetics due to their medications start to experience hypoglycemia once their a1c gets below 6.5
the ada sets the standards of care that most medical professionals follow: "lowering a1c to approximately 7% or less has been shown to reduce microvascular complications of diabetes, and, if implemented soon after the diagnosis of diabetes, it is associated with long-term reduction in macrovascular disease
therefore, a reasonable a1c goal for many nonpregnant adults is 7%
providers might reasonably suggest more stringent a1c goals (such as ,6.5%) for selected individual patient"   complete standards here &hellip;  http://bit
y/1qcqdke    steve my last a1c was 5.5
had blood done again about 5 days later, fasting glucose was 104, a1c level was 5.7&hellip;i was told i had "borderline diabetes"
140-199 on a 2 hour ogtt   for diabetes 126+ fasting glucose 200+ on an 2 hour ogtt random glucose of 200+ and symptoms of diabetes (eg extreme thirst)   the a1c has been proposed as a diagnosing tool, not sure where it stands but i think it was 6.0-6.4 for pre-diabetes and 6.5+ for diabetes
she said my a1c was 5.7 so there was nothing to worry about
my a1c was 10.7 in januany ***  and my bg's are still 260-450 each day al l day long
yet, i have lost 25% body weight in 5 years, and a1c is 5.7
sometimes referred to as the hba1c test, the a1c test is quite simply an average measurement of your blood sugar over the past 90 days
for people with diabetes, an a1c level of 7% or lower is considered healthy
diabetic's a1c level is around 9%
my a1c is at 5.3 at the last test
my last a1c was 5 up from 4.8 three mts ago
my last a1c was 5 up from 4.8 three mts ago
my last a1c was 5 up from 4.8 three mts ago
i refuse to attempt to lower my a1c lower than 7
god's best to you james   ps:  i just noticed your a1c of 5.5%
as of my last check up my blood sugar a1c is now 6.5 boy am i glad i had to change
i feel better than when i was taking the actos (a1c was 7.5 most of the time)
om what's your a1c i just had a baby on last year and my baby weighted 6lbs
my last a1c was 8.2 and that is to high for me
my last a1c was 8.2 and that is to high for me
so far i have lost 19 pds and my a1c has dropped from 7.4 to 6.8
my last a1c was 8.2 and that is to high for me
my last a1c was 8.2 and that is to high for me
my a1c had gone up from 6.4 to 6.8
i once again have hope of getting my a1c down below 6
my a1c has been between 6.0 and 6.2 for 22 years, and i feel just fine
i am on 16 units right now, and have been for about 2 months, and my last a1c was 6.2, so doctor says i am doing well
i was so nervous about my a1c but it dropped 3 points
a1c in the 6's is fine, as is a blood glucose in the mid 100's
for me, limiting my daily carbs to 120 grams has helped me keep my hba1c in the 6's
as i've posted, my a1c has been around 5.5 for more than two years
my a1c is 6.2
after islet transplantation, hba1c was normalized, and time spent while hypoglycemic (&lt;70 mg/dl) was nearly abolished as indicated by continuous glucose monitoring
mine has gone up slightly, not badly, like 155 first thing in the morning, mostly every day, goes down later on, but there is a trade-off there, incapacitating headaches vs higher bs in the morning-my a1c is still at 6.2, so my dr is still happy
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
my a1c is 5.5
my a1c was 9.3 yikes
my doctors office called yesterday (friday) the blood work that they took showed my a1c level to be at 11.4&hellip; my doctor put me on metformin 1,000mg per day, and after the call friday i was given a new prescription to use with my metformin called amaryl 2mg per day and once my medical insurance kicks in i will be prescribed injections, they said its not insulin and it will be 1 or 2 times a day&hellip; i was so shocked at all that i didnt think to ask if i was now considered type 1 or still type 2
tml english i had been having my a1c for the last 6months come in at 6.2
she called yesterday and said my a1c was 6.2 ,my thyroid was good but i had a very low vitamin d level and to start taking 5000 units of vitamin d a day
tml english hi everyone, my last a1c was 6.2, yay
sandra hi, actually my a1c has never been higher than 6.6, i liked 5.8, but will definitely take the 6.2
i am insulin dependent and last a1c was 6.2, which my doc said was good
i have no motivation, love sweets, a1c went up to 10, went from not eatting to eatting too much
james just can't get my a1c levels down my suger has been from 388 to 500 so now i have to eat very little and not beard no rice, no pasta  all natural fruits and vegetables but they whant me to eat a little all day long no big plats but small portions
to lower your a1c, keep your bg (blood glucose) levels as close to normal (80-120 mg/dl) as you can for about 90 days and your a1c will come down closer to normal as well
after all i did manage to drop over 50 pounds of weight&hellip; case in point &hellip; my meters 30 day average over the past three months has been 108-111 (5.2-5.3 a1c); i just got the results of tuesdays a1c test and it was 5.8 which would be a 129 average mg/dl blood glucose level
i did an a1c home test and the result was 6.1 which is pretty consistent with my meter results
but when my doctor ran an a1c about 1 week later, it was 6.3
unexpected highs and lows will also affect your a1c reading when you don&#39;t see them on your meter
according to the average on my meter my last a1c should have been 6.1 but was actually 6.3
howdy steve i nave never used the average bg readings as it has no relationship to the a1c readings as the a1c is 24 hr bg reading for 90 days skewed toward the last two weeks
my last hba1c was 6.6 and my average bg was somewhere in the 130's
thanks so much feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
i have lost 65 lbs in 5 mo, have generally kept my bg (blood glucose) levels in the 80 to 130 mg/dl range and at one point had an a1c of 5.5%
i have been able to bring down my a1c to 6.8mmol/l (120g/l) and stay off meds
i'm planning to go off soon, after my next doctor appt don't be in such a rush to go off your metformin&hellip;107 is great progress as far as a fasting bg is concerned&hellip;but a slight increase is to be expected if you go off your metformin&hellip;a little unwelcomed advice&hellip;see it you can beat your fasting numbers down to under 100&hellip;and get a few a1cs under your bag that you are comfortable with before going off the meds&hellip;again&hellip;i know you didn't ask&hellip;and i love to see people so enthusiastic about their progress&hellip;but yeah i would tread lightly&hellip;i waited for a few a1cs i was comfortable with before i went off&hellip; i hear ya, and please, advice all you want
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
i use:  average blood sugar plus 77.3 divided by 35.6 = a1c i also have a chart - this one actually goes down to 4.0 (bg 68), just in case :)  have a great day
best of luck to you and putting your legs up ( elevating them ) helps alot and if you think it is your kidneys take it easy on the salt and protein &hellip; yay, party time, a1c is 5.3 wow
my a1c was at 6.6
my a1c was 12.04 after test
in first three months i brought my a1c from 11.7 to 5.5
a1c was 6.4
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
the a1c will cost about $10/test
i am curious now am about 1 1/2 months  without a1c checked, may try this within the next 2 weeks
tml english i was diagnosed  as a type 2 in 2007 with an a1c of 10.0
at that time i was advised that i should try and get my a1c to under 7.0 in order to avoid complications
3 months later my a1c was 6.6 &hellip; at which time i was told that i should get it to under 6.0 in order to avoid complications &hellip; 4 months later my a1c was 5.8 and has remained with in 0.1 of that for the past 6 1/2 years
my a1c is 5.8 i have never seen a bg reading above 178 or below 73
i am trying to hard to get my a1c below 6 and so far it just won't
i've been able to keep my a1c's in the 6's
i am committed more than ever to getting my a1c into the 4's &hellip; it might take a couple years but i am adopting a "take no prisoners" attitude when it comes to diabetes management
the lowest my a1c has been is 5.8 and that is now
pays to count carbs my lowest a1c was 7.0
about 6 years ago, i got my a1c down to 5.9
my a1c #s july 2011 -  12.3 november 2011 -  7.6 february 2012 -  5.6   after the last test the dr
my a1c was 10.8 in august of 2011
as of three weeks ago my a1c is 5.0
my last a1c was nov 2011 and it was 5.7
hi michael, thanks to mr irish i found a cool app for ipad it's free you plug in your average and it gives your your a1c, all i did was search diabetes + a1c and it gave me several options
my initial bgs were 400, so the initial a1c must have been 12+, but not knowing how important that reading would be, i didn't make a note of it
my last a1c was 5.4 but my cholesterol was a bit higher than my dr
i'm type 2 and the a1c is satisfactory however in keeping track of my facting sugar i find the reading is all over the chart, so i'm using 2 meters periodially just monitor my situation i have been told that the accuracy of a measurement can change if you use two drops of blood from the same prick
i didnt fast before i went because i wasn't feeling well&hellip; turns out my bg was 570 &amp; my a1c was 13.2
also, diabetes can "go away" once your a1c stays at 5% for one year (meaning, if you get it there and are med free for one year, you are primarily home free but you can't eat all the crap out there
sherelle, i was diagnosed on 05/06/13 and my bg was 335 and my a1c was 14.5
my a1c has gone from 14 in august to 5.4 in april
all of her lab test came back with good results, a1c was 6.5
one year ago my weight was 215 now i am down to 178 my last three a1c were 5.4,5.4,and 5.1 but i am still diabetic and will be the rest of my life   alan ask the doctor to send you to a diabetic education course and to see a nutrionist
my doctor tests my a1c levels every 3 months
i don't know if exercising for 30 min will drop you a1c by 3.5 points but i do know that when i exercise regularly my bs is in the normal range
my a1c was 7 and my doctor started me on metformin 500mg 1 time per day
my a1c test results went from 16 in oct
before using cinnamon my a1c was above 8 and since using cinnamon with no other changes in either diet or lifestyle it is now 6.4 so  i would say it certainly would be worth a try have not had any luck with cinnamon; think the diet and exercise has been most helpful;  but am using cinnamon stix in tea; just not often anymore
tml english i am so mad about my diagnosis that i cant seem to get passed that long enough to take care of myself&hellip; i'm afraid if i dont wrap my head around all this real soon it will be to late and too much damage will be done i guess i'm finally reaching out for support and tips my a1c is 12+ my feet and toes are numb i have all the resources to do it i just wont&hellip; it is so hard
in just two months my a1c went from 9.4% to 7.5%
my last (and only) a1c test was at the doctor's office the day i was diagnosed (april of 2011) and it was 10.6 (which is bad i know)
~mays~ well  will your doc take the test as is or will they order a a1c a0s well or do you just wish to know what youe a1c is
to test your a1c more frequently won't give you a more accurate or better result since it is a 3 month average reading of bg
a1c was 6.6 and readings are good, but i am anti-statins
tml english hi all it was really nice to find this forum  i was diagnosed with type 2 diabetic by the end of december (a1c was 16 and fasting test was 345) when i went the doctor (my random test was around 595) and i was feeling very bad
by the end of feb i got off medication (after a lot of changes) i got my a1c result last week and it was 6.4 and i feel much better my concern right now is to gain some weight (i know it's the opposite of what a lot of people with t2 want), i lost a lot of weight and i m not getting any pounds with my actual diet and exercise
i was diagnosed 10 years ago, see the doctor every three months, get my a1c tests, take my meds, but didn't get my exercise, have a sitting job all day long and quit checking my glucose daily because i figured the a1c was all i needed
i have my diabetes well under control and my a1c this last time was 5.5
my a1c is 6.5
just spoke to the dr and my a1c is 13.5
can't explain as well as nick &hellip; i can tell u this though my last a1c was also 13 point something &hellip; was on insulin shots , #'s were still outta control &hellip; my doctor was a firm believer in the pump &hellip; urged me to get one and to change my life style &hellip; well i got one ( a pump ) and yes i've changed my eating habits too  &hellip; i'm doing so much better &hellip; i advocate the pump to anyone having a hard time controlling their diabetes &hellip; it really works
your hemoglobin a1c test (or hba1c, glycated hemoglobin test, or glycohemoglobin a1c) is actually a 3 month or so average of your blood sugar expressed as a percentage
tml english my a1c was 10.3 but my numbers are from 103 to 150 on the a1c chart it says my numbers should be over 200 something and there not
you need to get your a1c to 6.5%
i went to the doctor 3 days ago and my a1c level was 6.5
i did really well on mdi  (lowest a1c then was 5.9) until a few years back when my sugars were climbing but i was also having scary morning lows
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
my personnel numbers ran between 240 and 270 with an a1c of 11.7 six months ago
my a1c has dropped to 5.7 and i average a waking bs anywhere from 88 to 104 daily
it took a while to do, but i am happy that my bg numbers are in the normal range and my last a1c was 5.5
i'm not sure, i was diagnosed a month after you was on the same meds but 3mg of glimepiride once a day and my a1c went from 8.4 to 9.1 and i just started on levemir insulin today and was discontinued on all my meds
still too much blood&hellip;but he said at the 4 month mark which is where im at they decide to either drain the blood from the eye with real eye surgery or wait a month&hellip;mine is doing much better so get to wait a month&hellip;whew great news on the a1c of 7.2, keep up the good work&hellip;you can do it
so in march my a1c was a 10.9(yikes) today its 7.2&hellip;yeah me sounds like you are handling all of it well
my a1c is close to 7 now
i drink 2-6 cups of tea a day and my last a1c was 6.1 &hellip; so, until i can handle unsweetened tea i'll stick with the aspartame
and sice last october 2008 have maintained an average of 126 fasting and have an a1c of 6.5
in january, two doctors told me i was and one told me i wasn't diabetic with an a1c of 6%
my a1c is 6.8%
i started this project at 308 (a1c at 11.8) on march 2, 2015
my a1c has dropped from 7.8 to 6.5 in the last three months (when i started with all the changes)
i too was recently diagnosed with diabetes my bg was over 400 and a1c was 11.8 my doctor called me dead man walking
started reading labels like a mad man watching my carbs and surgar intake, started exercising and it has been a little over 2 months and my bg is around the 120 mark, my a1c is down in the 6's, i have lost 15 pounds and i feel good
with an a1c of 11, your body has gotten accustomed to being high a lot of the time
although i'm a type 1, i've limited myself to 120 total grams of carb per day and have been able to keep my hba1c in the 6's and my weight around 120 lbs
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
my doctor has a schedule based on a1c results  7.0 or above every 6 weeks 6.5-7.0 every 3 months  less than 6.5 every 6 months
i'm still on every 3 months with my last a1c of 6.8
since that day, she has seen her endo, been given an a1c test (12.6) attending education classes and much more
tml english i go to my drs today and if my a1c insn't improved i am going to have to go from lantus once a day to humalog 3 times a day
my a1c averages 6.4 and my lab
a1c 5.4 so i'm doing pretty well on this regiment
my plan seems to have worked as a1c is 5.3, and the lipid panel is within the "normal" range
my a1c was a 5.3 thats was awesome,i thought but then he tells me that he still wants me to take my meds
i was diagnosed type 1 a year ago &amp; my a1c is 6.7
my a1c is 7.5    not good, but i thought it would be worse than that
your a1c would fall between 6 and 7%
my  l-5 s-1 is badly messed up they cancelled my surgery until, my a1c levels r  down, if i could walk my levels would never have been this high,  am very scared of what might happen if i cant get it down from 13, any suggestions would be appreciated,  thxs try not to get  scared  because it causes stress and avoid any stressful situations as much as possable stress will cause hi blood sugar levels to and readings oh, my - i feel your pain
tml english hello all, i got great news on friday at an endocrinology appointment - my a1c is down to 5.9
after my last a1c  of 5.7 in may i discussed the possibility of getting off the 500 mg 2x daily i have been taking with my doctor
instead of 60iu of lantus 2x daily, i am doing 40iu 2x daily and my a1c is slightly lower than it was 9 months ago
just a hint&hellip; my a1c was 11.4&hellip; scary
my first a1c was over 14, my second&hellip;almost a  yr
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
i am happy to say that i had my year tests and my a1c is @ 6.5 (six months ago @ 7
since i started tracking what i was eating and exercising i brought my a1c down from 8.9 to 5.8 in 4 months and went off glipizide
here's what it says:   people without diabetes: fasting and before meals: less than 100 1-2 hours after meals: less than 140 bedtime: less than 120 a1c: less than 6   suggested ada goals: fasting and before meals: 90-130 1-2 hours after meals: less than 180 bedtime: 110-150 a1c: less than 7   suggested ace goals: fasting and before meals: less than 110 1-2 hours after meals: less than 140 bedtime: &mdash;- a1c: less than 6.5   hope this helps
the a1c test gives you an average for the last 90 days or so
if your a1c is 6.5 or less, this is pretty good
my last a1c was 5.8
well i am doing good on the victoza just wanted to give update feeling good, going for a a1c test tomorrow so will know on the 10th when i go see pcp last one was 6.1
still having trouble swallowing but doing better still in st so will keep you updated update on my victoza just wanted to let you know that my insurance as gave the okay for me get my victoza it was going to cost me 116dollars for a copay which is crazy but the discount from my sample the doctor gave me took it t 25.00 for 3 pens and this stuff works i am keeping my average at about 95 to 109 and that is fro an average from 180's to the 140's my a1c was 6.1 i go in august to have labs again to see what  a1c is after 2 months on this
my a1c at dx was 11.7, six weeks after i got it down to 8.5 now i am ranging between 5.5 &amp; 5.9
i went into the er and found that my bg level was 618&hellip;i had an a1c test done a few weeks ago and i'm at 10.7 so they think i have been diabetic for awhile and just didn't realise it
unlike fuhrman, mcculley actually had diabetes and an a1c of 1337 which put him into a diabetic coma
also my a1c is 6.2
i slipped on my last hba1c to 6.9 (i'd gotten it down to 6.6 in august
i did thought my a1c was lot higher then i thought it was but it was 8.4
usually the a1c is  usually done every 3 months or so
my a1c is at 6.2 so the overall average is good
and does this mean my results for my a1c (hba1c) will be good
our daily bg readings vary, of course, but they like to see them in the 70-120 range on our (us) meters, whereas our a1c readings, usually done every three months at the doc's, they want to see (and this too is up for debate) a 7.0 to a 6.0 or less
i see my doctor on tuesday so i have not taken it yet until i talk to my doctor because i believe tuesday they're gonna do a1c so i wanted to do the a-1 c and then i will start taking that herb
i am 42 and my last a1c was three weeks ago and was 7.0
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
tml english hello all my new a1c was the best ever 5.8 it is geting easyer to keep it down the longer i work on it
my last a1c was my best ever also, 5.4
my last a1c was 6.5, and i had had a lot of lows&hellip;don't know what it will be this time&hellip;i just had my bloodwork done last week but haven't gotten the results back yet&hellip;i'm scared to find out what it is going to be&hellip;i have a lot of highs as well as lows&hellip;i bottomed out last night at 43 (it has been in the 30s), and i over compensated for the low, and it went up to 313&hellip;it is very scary
finally got my 4 page report, a1c 5.8  hdl 46  ldl 84 the cholesterol has improved a lot from my last lab work total was 144 my triglyerides have improved as well 68
tml english i was prediabetic for about 3 yrs with my last a1c 6.5
tml english so when i started metformin my a1c was 5.7
after 4 weeks of 1000mg/day i tested my a1c fasted and i was 6.0
remember a1c is a 90 day average&hellip;not 28 days
i went to do the follow up with my doctor yesterday and she said while an increase of a1c from 5.7 to 6.0 is not good, it's only one reading and wants me to come back for another test in 3 months
my a1c has been up around 10-12
a1c of 10 at diagnosis, 7.6 a month later, and 5.3 at 4 months post diagnosis
the more i think about this the more i am developing an real opinion&hellip;a1c test can be off by as much as .5&hellip;so a "rise" of .3 may not be a rise at all&hellip;i recommend waiting to see what your next a1c is&hellip;and cut back on the carbs&hellip; jibber,   ok, let's say you're right and a 0.3 movement is not a movement at all
but yeah i cut them down to 20 a day to begin with and my a1c dropped like a ball being tossed from a roof&hellip; 20 grams
when i was diagnosed in 2005 my a1c was 12.5
my a1c was 5.7 and my bs was 90
that's when i read that although a rage of 4-6.0 for a1c is normal, the range between 5.7 and 6.0 was prediabetic
now you say my a1c  going up 0.3 was due to my diet
the a1c test is not a simple average of the previous 2 - 3 months rather it is weighted towards the previous 4 weeks since roughly 1/2 of your red blood cells present were formed in the 4 weeks prior to the test &hellip; so yes, it can go up (or down) in just 4 weeks)
as with most doctors she had no creativity whatsoever and referred to the stand chart of obesity and the a1c ranges and my waist size and that my 13.4% body fat was not bad
my a1c has dropped another .3 to 5.5
6081-new-site-member---a1c-6-0
a1c = 6.0 fasting blood glucose = 98   everything else came back ok
my current a1c is 6.7
my a1c last month was 5.4 so i must be doing something right, but the weight is getting to me
my last a1c was 11.1
my last a1c was up by .2 to 7.0&hellip;i had expected it to be lower
my a1c was 6.7 at the time
all of my numbers have improved, especially my a1c, it has went from 12.7 to 5.6
for example got my a1c on tuesday and was shocked to see it was unchanged from three months ago of 5.9 which i tell myself is a great number then move on
i just get back on track my a1c went to 9.2 so i am very determined to get them back around to normal i upped my excercise and watching more closely to what i eat
my a1c is 5.5 and i watch what i eat
he says once is enough becasue my a1c is 5.5
have kept my a1c between 5.6 - 5.9 for almost two years
my last hba1c was 6.9 but many pumpers here have lower a1c's
a1c and daily testing offer different things&hellip;yet similar&hellip;   if your a1c is good you can feel good about it&hellip;but&hellip;if you experience hypoglycemic events etc while this doesn't make your a1c bad&hellip;its is bad because it effects your brain&hellip;(damage etc)&hellip;so while a1c indicates overall control you really want to be aware of how high or low you are going at individual moments as well&hellip;   its important for the fasting test to make sure that is in good range&hellip;and then its also important to test before, and 1 hour after meals sometimes too&hellip;certain foods could spike you way up&hellip;those are the foods you want to stay away from&hellip;but you wont know what they are unless your testing to see&hellip;   testing is so annoying :(  but its honestly the only way we can pilot our own vessel&hellip;   i hope everything turns out to be in good form for you danni&hellip;but its def better to know then not know :) it damages your brain too
meaning nothing overlooked&hellip;where as your own personal testing can be a "not as accurate" average because you are testing only at certain times and may not test at a particular time where you are high or low&hellip;   *if you want to see what average your a1c is indicating there are conversion charts that take your a1c and translate that to a home treatment number average&hellip;and then you'll see that your average range is 100 or 130 or 200&hellip;so you can see what the number indicates if you use the conversion chart :)   the a1c test should be used in addition to your daily blood sugar testing
be well :) the a1c gives you better insights into what is going on with your blood sugar 24/7 for the last two to three months
good luck with your a1c go to walmart they have an a1c test you can get for 8 to 15 bucks and they work good too  sorry your having truble getting ins  best wishes harlen sounds cheap enough, i'll check it out
tml english my a1c approx 5 months ago now, was 6.2
an a1c of 6.2 is a good one for people with diabetes, but normal a1c is in the 4-5 range
i know i am in pretty decent shape as compared to many people on here with diabetes&hellip; i am fortunate in that i think (maybe) i am catching this pretty early on&hellip; thankfully i asked my gyn to do a random a1c&hellip; so&hellip; with that said, i took your advice &hellip; i ate something with carbs (a breaded tenderloin on white bread - at a fair) and checked my bs at one hour after eating it&hellip; and it was 169
i was just at my family practice doc's for a physical and brought up the a1c result from 5 months ago and she said i was fine&hellip;no worries at all about me having diabetes&hellip;even though it runs heavily in my family
an a1c of 6.2 and a 1-hour postprandial blood glucose reading sounds like diabetes to me &hellip; okay, maybe insulin resistant &hellip; whatever you want to label it is most certainly not "nothing" getting ahead of this now will be a whole lot easier than waiting until it becomes "something"   steve steve - i am not in shape, by any means&hellip; i meant&hellip;in shape as far as diabetes goes
yes, starting at an a1c is a better spot than where most of us started (i was 10.0) in my non-medical opinion you would be best served by shedding that 30 pounds by way of as low carb intake as you can handle and by working out with an emphasis on increasing muscle (add some weight training to your routine) keep in mind that the changes you are making will probably need to be sustained for the rest of your life &hellip; which (imo) is a very good thing, as an active lifestyle with a healthy way of eating is the best way to avoid a multiple number of health issues
aim your blood sugar to be 80 to 180, and your a1c (the important measurement) will be in the 6's, which is perfect
my a1c now is  a 6
she actually said to me with a a1c of 5.6 you aren't diabetic
one of those things was that i was putting myself in danger when i maintained an a1c of below 7.0   i think the person who said that to me meant well, but was, i believe, operating with old information that's about on a par with the person who told me i would suffer brain damage by following my low carb diet
like copperchef said "you can't fix stupid" i was just told my my endo, that i should be trying to raise my a1c to 7.0, due to my age
been  in the 5.2 to 5.9 a1c range for over 10 years
james, maybe that study, showing that seniors a1c should be about 7.0, could that be  what the person here on dc meant
tml english hey guys went for 6 mos, a1c check had went up to 7.9 sooo, i have got to get back on track, job, stress , got to pick excercise back up, wish me luck, i will need it, go back to dr
was 7.9 a1c in march 7.5 diet controlled' aic in april was 7.3 insulin&hellip; the reason for the last change was that my c peptide came up (does not seem to to fit type on) frim .83 to 1.80
tml english i just got my labs back, my a1c is 4.7 and my fasting was 83
my latest a1c was 8.9, but, this is a total improvement over the time prior
i am glad to see you had a great report on your levels as well 4.7 a1c and a fasting glucose level of 83
tml english just came from doctor my a1c is down from6.6 to 6.0 hooray
james hi mac, congratulations on lowering your a1c and loosing 18 lbs
job well done&hellip; hay mac:  congratulations on losing 18 lbs and having your a1c go to 6.0
my a1c is now at 5%
when i was dx, my a1c was 6.8
i sorta followed his diet plan (loosely), and in 5-6 weeks dropped my a1c down to 5.7
i didn't eat right though i did take the metformin the docter put me on but never tested or anything my a1c1 was useally around a 5 when i went in for that test
have lost 20lbs,cut my insulin intake in half,cut my cardiac medications in half,my a1c has dropped from 11.9 to 7.5 all this in six months riding a bike
the next day i received a call stating that my a1c was 8.4 which is too high and i was "pre-diabetic
long story short, i got a second opinion from another internal medicine doctor, who checked all my levels and determined that my fasting glucose was 127mg and my a1c was 9.4
i have discontinued breads of all kinds and crackers and pastas from my eating plan  my may 2011 a1c was 5.5
tml english a1c at 5.8, 500 mg of metformi a day but urine has gotten foamy again, why
my a1c in june was 7.68, so i am looking forward to that number being much lower
so he will probably want to do my a1c before i run out, as it will be 3 months since the last test
iet is the best control you have, i've had it for 3 years, and now have an a1c of 5.3&hellip;lost 70 lbs and the doctor says by december i'll be off meds
the numbers below are good&hellip;i shoot for 80 to 180 and that gives me an a1c in the 6's
my last a1c was 7 (not too bad) and that was down from a 10.9 so that was good for a two month spread
keep making the progress you have made so far and soon your a1c will got below 6 also
wow kevin thats awesome i go for my 2nd a1c test augest 31 first test was 10.7 lost 50lbs since then thanks for sharing your story aaron if you run from 70 to 130 that is your range  my tatget range is 80 to 125  i hope thats what your asking  best wishes harlen i have never been at 70
my last a1c was 7.0 and i'm working to get it back into the 6's
had a great chat with my diabetic nurse on thursday, told her i was struggling both emotionally and physically - to cut a long story short, the bad news my hba1c result is 11.2%, i knew it would be high, but not that high
determined to get my hba1c down to at least 7% by christmas
the best thing to do is to go to a specialist and follow their rules and take all the education they want to give you the endos in ireland strongly recommend thast women should have their hba1c around 6.5 before concieving
my a1c is 8.0 and my doctor does not want to make any changes to my regimen
tml english i have been a diabetic since 1989 when i was 25 but have never counted carbs my doctor retired last year and my new doc wants me to count carbs my a1c has ran 6.8 - 7.3 my last a1c was 6.7 in february
it works for me i just had my a1c and it was 6.1 weeeeeee  i use a lot of insulin my ratio is 2 grams carbs to one unit of insulin your ratio will be difrent
right now i am trying yo get my a1c into the mid 5's so i am keeping a really close eye on my bgl and testing fasting
since we have been dating my a1c is better than it has been in at least 6 or 7 years, i've started exercising regularly again and i am back down to a pre-college weight
tml english i want to thank all of you personally from the bottom of my heart for your thoughts and prayers it meant allot to me that i don't know how to put into words or express i'm still here and kickin just not as hard but i'll get there i'm on the road to recovery wow this t2 beat me down in the beginning but i'm winning the fight all my labs are great a1c in hospital 6.0 so why a day surgery turned into a 4 day full blown hospital visit, ok so as you know i had surgery last week that took a turn for the worse towards end of surgery by bp fell to 60 was already kinda low as it averages about 100/60 and i quit breathing something about dying in the or made the whole hospital jump for about 20 minutes, my wife told me that when she heard the code called she new it was me she just had a cold feeling at that moment i'm so glad they were able to fix the problem that had arose and brought me back i was on the ventilator for about 20 hours and the wired  monster as i call it the whole time, i looked like a robot that was tore open wires and tubes everywhere they kept me in hospital till this morning now i have to do a sleep apnea test to rule that out never reacted that way over the last 6-7 surgeries maybe body is just tired of going under the knife i just need to rest for awhile when i got out i went directly to physical therapy wasn't happy about that im just really tired they said not sure ill ever walk again unassisted but time will tell the surgeons had to cut away more dead mussel than they anticipated to close the two fistulas
was a few years off my metformin and my a1c according to my doc is 14
:-) in fact, here&#39;s the list of the whole prize pack:    one $75 walgreens gift card  one bayer contour blood glucose meter  one bayer a1c now self check 2 self-test kit  one copy of betty crocker diabetes cookbook  one copy of calorie king calorie, fat, and carbohydrate counter  one 8 oz
i have that range and my a1c is the same as yours and i take 500 mgs metformin per day
i was told by my doctor i could come off of met if my a1c dropped below 6.0
:) danni marcus57   i was diagnosed last year with a a1c of 14.1 fasting blood sugar 366
a1c went to 5.9 4 months later
i still wonder, though&hellip;my a1c has been an 8, 5.9 , 7, 16, &hellip;it's been just about everything
sincerely, anne hi&hellip;i think i have talked to you before&mdash;-i feel bad, as i was intially diagnosed type 2 severe severe brittle diabetic, and the outstanding internist that found it did not find it in my a1c&mdash;-it turned up in another diabetic test as atrocious&mdash;&mdash;-several years untreated, too&hellip;that doctors office found out i did not have health insurance and they basically got rid of me&hellip;in the meantime he said i showed way too many signs of type 1, i have been given insulin about 5 times&mdash;&mdash;almost admitted for kedoacisosis&mdash;&mdash;help
i am not prediabetic at all, that was already recorded, but, on the humorous side of things, if one were to just look at my a1c, it is usually 5.9
i am not prediabetic at all, that was already recorded, but, on the humorous side of things, if one were to just look at my a1c, it is usually 5.9
the internist i had said i was diabetic without a doubt, as i had a past a1c of 8 along with triglycerides that were way overboard, along with severe severe severe symptoms
it did show up in an a1c back in 1996
i was fully expecting to get lectured on what i need to do, instead he told me my a1c was a 6.2
last week i was surprised with wonderful lab results (3 pages worth) and everything is great, and my a1c was down to 6.5
need some advice  my current a1c is 10.8 1- lifestyle changes:       - no smoking, no alcohol, physical activity, etc
an a1c is a 3 month average test that has mostly been done at the doctors office but now can be done at home as well&hellip;wal-mart carries them as well as several diabetes web sites
to get a basic idea of one's a1c (long term blood glucose), a morning fasting reading (for all pwd) and an evening reading before dinner (for t1) or 2 hours after dinner (for t2) will give a rough estimate
i tested 2 times a day for the first 6 months but since october my a1c has been at 5.6 so i am testing 2 times a day for another week and then i get to start testing once a day and as long as everything stays in the normal range i will be allowed to reduce it to once every couple of days
my diabetic doc said that because my a1c hhad been between 5.5 and 5.7 for over a year i needed to test only once a day, and wrote the prescription for only 1 test/day
i am type one, and have been working really hard over the last 12 months to get my hba1c below 6.5%
a1c's is a lab test that gives your dr a better idea what your blood sugars have been like over a 3 month period
if you have a high a1c that means that for the past 3 months your blood sugars have been in a high range
i am lucky with my diet in that i eat between 1500 and 2000 kcalories a day, and maintain an a1c of 5.5
tml english i'm gonna have bariatric surgery in the new year but need to lower my a1c to 10 or lower
plus i have had diabetes a long time and been around dc for about 5 yrs and i have heard of only one way to lower your a1c and that is to give blood,  there is no substance or miracle pill to lower one's a1c
i kept my bg levels in the normal range, achieved an a1c of 5.5 and i lost weight on that meal plan almost as a by product
i really want to get my a1c below 6 and i would love to get off the metformin, if possible
i managed to knock my bg #'s down to 150 on my own before i found my great new dr and with his help (and more drugs) my a1c is already down to 6.5 and my bg, tho not yet perfect, is under control
my a1c is currently 6.5, and my fasting blood sugar is always high
my initial a1c was 9.1 and down to 5.7 3months later
i try to control the stress but that is a rare thing, we moved december 23rd, had xmas, husband started new job the day after xmas, our daughter was having high readings but an a1c was normal so it was dismissed, in january we went to denver to what is now her past ped endo for 1 last visit that was horrible and we felt rejected because we'd told them we moved and found a ped endo closer to home
34802-5-5-a1c---down-65-pounds-and-taken-off-metformin
tml english i had my 6 month meeting with my diabetes consultant nurse practitioner this past friday and was delighted to find my a1c at 5.5
i was diagnosed in april 2010, with type ii, and have been very cognizant of the foods i should and shouldn't eat, and was able to keep my glucose levels in control by was always in the standard target range, keeping my a1c above 6
sounds a little like me as i lost 65 lbs in 5 mo and had an a1c of 5.5% as well, but i came off of twice daily injections of nph insulin by foiiowing the meal plan i developed (link available on request)
my last a1c was 5.3, but my doctor did not say anything about taking me off meds
&hellip;great news all around&hellip;i will "formally" be taken off my metformin at my next doctors vist at the end of next week&hellip;but i stopped taking my meds a couple weeks back after an at home test showed my a1c to be under 5&hellip;it is a wonderful feeling when you hit the nail on the head&hellip;congrats
tml english when i first found out the doc did a a1c and it was 14 last thursday did my 3 month check up and it came back friday and now its a 9 so its going down slowly but surely
y a1c was 9
my 1st a1c test was 10.7 also devolped 2 blood clots and heart was damaged some
tml english i received a letter in the mail yesterday from my primary doctor telling me: congratukations your a1c is 7.1 from 11.1 last year and kidney function is stable, dont really know what stable means yet until i see kidney doctor on the 25th but sounds good&hellip;atleast thats what the lab tests said :) i am so happy
chel-sea   i was diagnosed last year (feb 2009) with a a1c of 14.1
four months later my a1c was 5.9
all my a1c tests after the 14.1 have all been below 6
my last a1c was 6.6
up date on my son when we got to the walin this morning he was at 521 they tested his urine and blood and their were ketones present in both, he was admitted to the hospital and is getting insulin by iv 7units per hour at this point it is 249, they tested his a1c and it is 10.9 which they said his average bs for the last 3 months was 275&hellip;they were giving him a shot and said if he responded well to that they would take the iv out
his age does play into it but the ketones, high blood sugar and high a1c are very typical of a typical type 1 diagnosis
i have excellent control of my bg and last a1c was 5.5
my last hba1c was 5.8 (exactly where i plan on it staying)
nowm recently i had been loosing enough weight has helped my a1c's go from 7.8 to 6.1,and my diabetic specialist had my blood drawn and my numbers looking hella good

because i couldn't afford the increase in cobra payments two years ago, i haven't had an hga1c for close to 3 years
my a1c went from 14.1 to 5.9 in just a few months
my a1c is down, my creatnine is 1.3&mdash; a okay
i have followed my low carb high protein meal plan for a year now and my last a1c was 5.5 and i have maintained a nearly "normal" blood glucose readings
with this information, i have lost 80 lb and have kept my a1c to 5.5 and lower for over a year now&hellip; when i thought my pasta meals were over, i now know i can mange to eat pasta within reason and still maintain the correct carb intake&hellip;while i hate this diagnosis, it has saved my life
the american diabetic association suggest a bs score between 80 and 120 and an a1c of 7 or below
between  70  and  130  should  be  fine,your a1c  should stay around 5 at  110  115  range
i always thought that if your a1c % is less than 6% you are considered as technically non-diabetic
true, "technically" not diabetic, which would correspond to a hba1c of 6.5 or blood sugar of 126mg/dl or more
hba1c more than 5.6 is consistent with "pre-diabetes"
beyond the normal hba1c of less than 5, there is a gradual and continuous worsening of outcome
by the time the diagnosis of "diabetes" is made with hba1c of 6.5 or more, or fasting blood glucose of 126 or more, significant loss of pancreatic beta cells has occurred, and development of atherosclerosis has been provoked for years
a hba1c of 6 should not be acceptable to you
and my a1c in the 6's
my a1c is 4.9
:) thanks that really helps because i'm on the same things as you and my a1c was 7.5 but i'm only 14
my last a1c was 5.8 and am also on cgm
tml english the good news is i dropped my a1c from 9.5 to a 7.9 in 3 months
hi marla, congrats on lowering your a1c from 9.5 to 7.9
when i was first diagnosed as diabetic, i had an a1c of 9.6
i am currently still working on keeping my a1c under 6.0 and it is a constant struggle
keep your chin up and never give up hope&hellip;amy that's great for a1c to drop that way but sorry for the other problem way to drop that a1c
the only way i was able to lower my a1c (6.5 to 5.7) was to leave my beloved performance career
as soon as i stopped my a1c went from 6.5 to 5.7
at diagnosis, my a1c was over 11 and my first home reading was over 500 - too high for my meter to register
but, my a1c is down now to 6.8 it had gotten down to 6.2 and doctor said it was to low now she says its just right my first one was 13
i found out that since being off of avandia, my ha1c has gone up to 7.4 which is not so good
well, i got pregnant by accident &amp; i was so worried because my a1c at the time i found out was 11
tml english someone had mentioned they dropped their a1c in 3 months
i was diagnosed with type ii diabetes in june with an a1c of 7.8
17, i had dropped 30 pounds and my a1c to 6.6 through working out on my bike and limiting my carb intake to 210 carbs or less per day and my total calories to 2,000 or less daily
i dropped my a1c in 3 months, i went from an 11 (diagnosed) to 5.4
tml english what us consider full blown diabetic my one doc says i am p/d and one says i am full blown diabetic i though all this time i was pre/d i lost 40# in 6month my chlo went to normal range my b/p is116/65 last week my a1c was 5.6 6.3 back in july need answer and i am not in ant kind a med sounds like you are doing well
you say that in 6 months you have lost 40 pounds, your a1c has gone from 6.3 to 5.6, your bp and cholesterol are normal
keep up the good work&hellip; forgot to add that my a1c went from 5.6 to 5.4
my new a1c is 5.7 and i couldn't be happier about that
i think i was caught pretty early 2 years ago with a fasting bg of 127, failed a glucose tolerance test, and then my a1c was 7.0
i'm happy to report that my a1c is 5.7
i've charted my test results and managed to keep my a1c level between 5.4-5.7
i was on 1500 ml then i got a better a1c- so they took away 500 ml&hellip; then my numbers went crazy- so they put me back on the 1500- my numbers have settled-but not my tummy
when i was first diagnosed my a1c was 7.4 then it went down to 6.2 i recently just had another round of blood work done and praise god my a1c came back 5.9 i am thrilled with the grace god has for me
my may 2011 a1c was 5.5 and my weight has dropped about 50 lbs my numbers have finally been in control the last two months because the dd added carb counting
november 10, 2008 type 2 medication-metformin 1000mg (daily) a1c in october-5.6   morning fast- 90 after breakfast- 105   b4 dinner- 109 after dinner- 93 mine are horrible today and i feel it

my last a1c was 7.7 here are my counts so far for today 11-20-08  7am fasting 65, 8am 230           12pm 291, 2:30pm 293           7pm 252, 10pm 274 for breakfast i ate an egg sandwich and orange juice
my doctor told me because when i first came to see her, my a1c was 13.1 now 1 year later my a1c is 5.8
my a1c was done on nov.7th 08  its 5.8 i alternate checking my sugars before breakfast and dinner and the next day i check before lunch and before bed  yesterday my sugar was 99 before breakfast and 88 before dinner today i will check it before lunch well people, i have done the pills an they didnt work, so they put me on novolin r an n
i got my lab results back today&hellip;my a1c is 10.70 which isnt the greatest, but considering i've only been diagnosed for 2 months or so, i am considering it a starting point&hellip;my numbers have been averaging about 110 the last 3 weeks&hellip;therefore i know that my next a1c will be alot better&hellip;   vicki insulin novolin 25 units before breakfest waking up 188 after breakfest 197 before dinner 234 7:40 am  5.5(99) 2.5 novorapid 11:56    7.6(136.8) &mdash;- 11.57    6.2(111.6)   3 nr 5:01pm   5.4(97.2)  4.5nr 9:00     6.4(115.2) 13lantus november 13, 2008:   133 at 7:00am - waking up 122 at 10:10 am - after breakfast 106 at 12:00 pm - before lunch 125 at 2:30 pm - after lunch 109 at 5:30 - before dinner great numbers again
m a1c is 7.5 and has been all this time
prior to that, my control had been quite good with mdi of lantus and novolog and hba1c's ranging from 5.9 to 6.7
in 2009/2010, my doctor kept upping my lantus because my a1c had crept into the 7's&hellip;but i kept having these scary lows and he never changed his approach
also, as the article says, keeping your a1c below 7 is paramount
i am hoping that is true &hellip; but then i was also hoping that keeping my a1c at or under 6.0 would prevent complications and that certainly didn't happen &hellip; who knows with the crazy "condition" yes, steve your guess is likely correct
my a1c has gone from a 12 something in july to a 5.3 at the end of december
getting your a1c down from 12 to 5.3 is a great achievement
it scared me to find out my a1c was a whopping 14.4
since a1c is the 24 hr average of your bg (blood glucose) levels over a 90 day  period, i doubt that one can bring it down very quickly
my 2nd wife had a lower a1c than we thought she'd have since she had 300 mg/dl readings and up, but that was due to her having several signifiagant hypos that month
my last a1c was 6.0 and this is why i can test once a day or every other day
(just a thought) my sugars are sky high, my last a1c was 8.1 and my fasting sugars are around 199 or so
my story i'll try to sum it up a little i was diagnosed aug 2012 was in denial and just like you did what i wanted to do well in nov 2012 ended up in icu for 3 months dka coded once and was brought back, my sugar levels were so high in er the lab was only ones who could count it at over 1000 decided to change my ways well it was a huge haul for me as i'm farm raised and was very athletic so i ate enough food at meals to feed 3 people but my work and lifting kept the weight off but after diag with t2 and icu didn't have the energy to work or workout but still ate the same thought insulin would fix it wrong fast forward couple months now its june 2013 and have so far had 4 surgeries and 2 trips to icu and spent so far 6 months out of last 7 in hospital fast forward to nov 2013 have spent  another 3 months in hospital and tons of dr appointments the complications have almost killed me again but i'm eating healthier now and feeling better so i'm getting there forward to jan 2014 just had 6th surgery and 2nd trip to icu all due to my mismanagement of t2 and stupidity in my thinking this was no big deal march 2014 got put on insulin pump and had 7th surgery doing better but will probably never walk unassisted again ever will see next surgery june 2014 had 8th surgery almost died on the table was technically dead 17 minutes to many surgeries and the amount of pain medicine i;m on caused that issue and they had to cut more muscle than they thought they would well i'm back at home still unable to walk correctly and not on my own at all going thru physical therapy now i eat right my bg levels are very good now my a1c is right at 6 was somewhere around 14-16 when all this first started i'm on my second pic line to administer medicine directly to heart as veins will not last in arms with iv treatments at home twice a day hope to get this one removed next month as long as everything keeps going well i hope you the best i paid for my ignorance and stupidity and i will never do that again and i try to pass along that to people i meet like you who used to be me allot of people on this website have helped me out with advise and prayer and i am truly thankful for that but even with there advice and prayer if i didn't myself make the choices ii did to quit well i wouldn't be writing this to you now with that i have not given up all my vices totally as with my current situation dr has let me keep smoking as i was very depressed giving up a total life change almost overnight i didn't get the slow progression most get now i have cut back on smoking to just when i really want one my dr says we will get all this fixed and dialed in then tackle the smoking but i only smoke a pack every week now was a pack a day so i'm  trying to wing them over time i've come a long way in 2 yrs you can to
finish what i said saw my mom die dylisis complication and  in on my father side grandparent and dad brothers of that side all died diabetics complicating i still didn't effect me but when kidney docter told me if don't get sugar down a1c to a 6 i will be on dylisis yes that scared me
my vet friend got really nervous and made me go to a dr and bingo, my a1c was 11.3 and i some albumin test came back high also i'm still dealing with high sugars a month later and feel pretty cruddy most days, so at the moment diabetes is a game changing event for me
hi kaydoo;  my a1c when i was dx was 12.9&hellip;now at my last one was 5.6
after a months my a1c was 6.4 three months after i got it down to 4.8
my a1c has been 7 for over 10 years
i told her about the sweet stuff i enjoyed right after my doctor told me i was doing great with a low a1c, healthy bp, and ldl below 100
i have a meal plan which i developed where i was able to dc my twice daily nph insulin injection, maintain a "normal" bg, achieve an a1c of 5.5, and over the space of 5 mo, lose 65 lbs and keep it off these past 3 yrs
tml english so as i've mentioned before i started in september with an a1c of 16
went worked out n i just checked my bg an it's 254 it was 422 so hopefully it goes down some more cuz i brought the bayer a1c today n it says if i manage to keep my bg between 90-140 my a1c will go down so imma manage to stay on the diet eat 3 times a day n take my insulin after every male n exercise after i take my insulin &amp; stay prayed up :) my blood count was 422 i tired to keep it under 150 as much as i can but everything i eat run it up so fast within a few mins so now imma go to the gym what are you eating to have a blood glucose count of 422
when i was diagnosed my a1c was 12.6% and i was having readings over 500
now a little over a year later my last a1c was 5.7% and my average readings for last week was 102
;-) 300-450 n that's really bad i'm trying to get my a1c down but i have not had my a1c check in over a year now so i'm going out n but the a1c now meter by bayer they sale it at walgreens so that mean my is a 12.6% rite yes that seems to be the case
my a1c came down to 7
i went from 260lbs to 246lbs and from a a1c 10.2 to 7.6 on my last blood test
i had an a1c of 5.5% for a while, after having a1c in the 6% region for quite a while
the need for dialysis has messed that up, however and i am having a1c in the 6% region again
praying for improving health for us all   james i have had an a1c of about 7 give or take a point for many years
i was stressed out and ended up with an a1c of 8
my hope is to maintain an a1c below 6 without medication
if you want to look in this direction, i will let you know what i have done to get my a1c to 5.5
i completed the study with great results having an a1c level dropping from 8.7 to now stable at 6.5
my doc said to get my a1c below 7, and ideally around 6.5 or lower, before getting pregnant
i have successfully reduced my cholesterol levels to the "ideal" range &hellip; i'm maintaining normal blood pressure &hellip; and a1c is at 5.8, all by reducing my weight to a normal bmi, quitting smoking and drinking, exercising daily and eating a low carb, high fiber diet, rich in omega-3's and other healthy fats
i had a1c's less than 6.0 for several years, but had the beginning stages of neuropathy and retinopathy
my last internist in 2005 told me that even though my a1c was only 5.9, that at 6.0 i'd be seeing nueropathy for sure&hellip;it happened
i was wondering why my a1c is so good ( 5.9), but i have terrible terrible joint pains, fevers that spike so easily, and was almost admitted for ketoacidosis 5 times in the last 5 years&hellip;every time i was in the emergency room over the last 5 years, they took my blood sugar and it read " keytones"  and hi
even if i were to stay like this for the next 3 months, i know my a1c will come down from 8.8
my blood sugar has been pretty controlled, and my a1c is 6.9, going down
just like manapua72 says i now use less insulin and my a1c was terrible a year ago now i'm at 5% which is excellent
u get used to it though &hellip; i'm getting my a1c done tomorrow &hellip; my last one was 13.7 , i know terrible that's one of the reasons i ended up on the pump &hellip; don't be afraid to bring it up , nothing to worry about &hellip; glad to hear u got your diabetes in control &hellip; pens , pumps , other meds or therapies main thing is u got your condition under control &hellip; good for u
my a1c was 6.2, so my doctor prescribed 500mg of metformin per day
i am in remission i consider myself to be, because my last a1c was 5.3 and the one before that, about a year or so before that one was 5.4 right now i control by diet and exercise, so this can be done, but&hellip;not for everyone, we are all different
most especially the longer you have it the more likely a1c goes up , bs goes up,but normal for a1c to go up and down and vary a lot
my a1c originally was 11.7, today it fluctuates between 5.1 and 5.4
i have t1, and my last a1c was 5.9 the doctor said if i was a t2 i would no longer need meds, unfortunately my pancreas no longer does the job of releasing insulin to my body, so i have to take care of this
fortunately, and you will get excellent advice from several others here, i have managed to control my bg for three years with "normal" blood sugar and a1c results about 5.6
the last time i had an a1c it was 6 but that was before the ulcer started and my diet was changed
my last a1c was 6.8 and i've had diabetes since 1976
i am working hard to get my a1c under 5.6 (been 5.9 for the past 6 months)
once my blood sugar went down and my a1c got to 6.5 it stopped
when i got pregnant my hba1c was 13
if you have a lot of lows then your a1c will go down and look good but in reality you would probably be better off with an a1c of 8.1 and no low blood sugar than you would with 6 or under and a lot of lows
just so you are aware, an a1c is usually taken about every 3 to 4 months because of what the test actually measures
a1c is an average of what your blood sugar readings have been over a 3 month period
dan that is great turtle:   my last check up was just a couple of weeks ago, and i was terrified to find out what my a1c was going to be because i had had so many highs and lows, then when i got the results of my blood work, my a1c was lower than it has been since i was diagnosed
my a1c in march of this year was 7.1 and in june, 10.2
my a1c was only 6.7 this last month and i eat out all the time
tml english i don't remember what my old numbers were ( i think i have a thread around here somewhere with them but don't remember) but i hadn't been seeing a doctor as much as i should (with moving to a new area i put it off)   anywho my a1c jumped to 13 have protein in my urine and slightly high thyroid hormone levels oh and low vitamin d   new doc wants me to see an endo so i see the endos np on friday   put me on lisinopril for the kidney's (no high blood pressure) and a once a week dose of vitamin d and increasing my insulin dose   needless to say i'm a bit depressed about it all of it particularly the protein in my urine   but its is a wake up call for me to keep back on my diet and to start exercising some so just as an added update went to a np at the diabetic center here in norfolk she upped my insulin dose a bit more and put me on victoza which sadly i need to look up the number for said diabetic center and call because my insurance doesn't cover it :( wake up calls come knocking on our doors at all kinds of different times
my last hba1c was 6.9
i noticed after i started taking it about 6-7 months ago that my a1c dropped and my morning readings have been steady and under 110
i've been on lisinopril since then but my a1c has come down dramatically and i've changed my diet (as far as sodium and caffeine) and i still haven't reached my best a1c but it's crazy how much it has come down since last year
i probably sound abrasive, but you've got to do whatever it takes to get your a1c down to the 6's;  otherwise, bad things will happen
i never give my self 15units cuz i k i need more insulin then that so i give me self 50units of novolog twice aday and i been doing that for months now and i think that's what gotten my a1c down some cuz i never change the way i eat and i pray each and everyday of my life i try to give god more time then i give anybody in this world hopefully i get my other blood work back from my other doctor yes a few days ago and he put me on metformin 1000mg twice aday he did some blood work on me and my a1c is 10.83 but a few months ago my a1c was 12.6 have you discussed this issue with your doctor
my a1c i found out today at diagnoses was 9.2 but the de said to me today that my number would be much, much lower when i have the test again in the last week in jan 2013 if i keep up with what i am doing now&hellip; so good news all around today
my first a1c i was over 13% range and yesterday i got my first 3 months results and i was at 6.7% my fasting bs was 79 monday when i had my test done
my a1c was 7
i also was use to weighing in the 120-130 range,  now i weight 167 and 5'7"  my last a1c was 6.0 before that 5.8
i lost 2# but my a1c was 6.6
wow  i was just grumpy on vacation and my blood sugar was 800 somthing my a1c was too high to read it just sed grater then 12 lol diabetes has chainged my life i will live and enjoy my life even with this what doesnt kill you makes you stronger best weishes harlen you have some serious angels looking out for you
i had an average a1c of 5.4 (such a dream, right
my last a1c during that time was 13.8
ust had my a1c i am finally at 5.9, good luck,best wishes thanks for the reply
my a1c is 5.6, but i expect it will get even lower
gabby, in answer to the a1c, this will be my 3rd this year
no stomach discomfort so far&hellip; i'll keep you posted and you keep me posted&hellip; well got my results for the a1c today, 6.5 which is down from 6.7
that's what i am told&hellip;my a1c in march was 6.5 and in june it was 6.7&hellip;i've had numbers over 200
tml english last time i was at the doctors my a1c was 13.1 which is not good at all
howdy anon yes an a1c of 13.1 is not good at all
i have developed a meal plan (available on request) where i maintained an a1c of 5.5 and lost 65 lbs over 5 mo all the while discontinuing my nph insulin and keeping my blood glucose (bg) levels in the normal ranges
a1c is a 2-3 month blood sugar average given in percentage form thanks, yeah i did some research on it
my a1c was 7.2 and he was happy with that as it was 11 at one time
i did get the results of my a1c and it was 7.1
my a1c has gone down from 7.0 to 6.1 in the past year
carb awareness and control has been the key for me to maintain my weight in normal ranges and keep my bg's manageable with my hba1c's in the 6's
feel free to respond but i don't get on here that often  thanks i feel the same way, my a1c is 5.1 and it has been like that for the past 10 years
my last a1c was 5.3 &amp; my bg readings are under 100
i have no kids and up intel last year i was fine i had yearly blood work done and everything was fine but once i saw my dr and mentioned it was what killed my mother she ran tests and said i was per d and i have tested my a1c 5.3 no i have not and im not going to waist my money
a1c is 6 or so and i havn't had a bs reading over 130 in almost a year from that you might still be in prediabetes mode
sounds like your pretty uneducated and for afact i went back and checed my paper work and my a1c is a 5.3
hi, glad to hear your a1c is 5.3 as it is a score in the normal range
i haven't completely found my way yet but i am trying&hellip;was in the hospital in july my a1c was over 14 and now my pre-meal is about 103&hellip;good job
and the result of my a1c test was 5.5 and my fasting blood sugar level was 97mg/dl
but when a1c came back at 9.3 late last year it scared me back into action
a1c is now at 7.4
my last a1c result was 6.7
today my a1c was 5.6 and i'm amazed and thankful
i'm not perfect, and with type 1 and hypothyriod [causing unexpected insulin shocks (not reactions but shocks)] my a1c's used to be about 12, now with working out my own amounts through the day and night, my a1c's are at 7 - 8 (not perfect but better)&hellip; btw: my doctors know nothing about insulin pumps so i've had to do this all myself with no help
i saw a few things that are not on my list but not much, my diet is pretty flexible and i'm maintaining a bgl average between 104-124 this winter, my last a1c in september was 5.7   for some this list is bad news and for others not so much
my last a1c was 12/31 and it was 6.0
the last couple of months his a1c was over 9 and his bs readings 250 and up consistently
my dr does the a1c blood test every 3 months
below; by mayo clinic staff for someone who doesn't have diabetes, a normal a1c level can range from 4.5 to 6 percent
someone who's had uncontrolled diabetes for a long time might have an a1c level above 8 percent
for most people who have previously diagnosed diabetes, an a1c level of 7 percent or less is a common treatment target
here's how a1c level corresponds to average blood sugar level, in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) and millimoles per liter (mmol/l):   a1c level estimated average blood sugar level 5 percent 97 mg/dl (5.4 mmol/l) 6 percent 126 mg/dl (7 mmol/l) 7 percent 154 mg/dl (8.5 mmol/l) 8 percent 183 mg/dl (10.2 mmol/l) 9 percent 212 mg/dl (11.8 mmol/l) 10 percent 240 mg/dl (13.3 mmol/l) 11 percent 269 mg/dl (14.9 mmol/l) 12 percent 298 mg/dl (16.5 mmol/l) 13 percent 326 mg/dl (18.1 mmol/l) 14 percent 355 mg/dl (19.7 mmol/l) thank you
you can get a meter that test your a1c but i prefer to have the blood test every 3-6 months
got my a1c to 6.4 and hope it doesn't go up after surgery
i had surgery last year and my a1c went up from 6.5 to 6.9 a month after surgery
my 4/1 aa1c was 6.0, so i seem to be doin apretty god job
my a1c never went down  and actually went from 8 something to 10.1 while i was on the pump
i don't think there could possibly be a better way to end my day then reading this&hellip;i actually got a little upset reading it because i had no idea you were going through such a personal trial&hellip;but i am thrilled that everything went well for you today&hellip;(smiling from ear to ear)&hellip; ah, thanks &hellip; i've been on a personal quest to see just how many diabetic complications i can acquire &hellip; while keeping my a1c at 6.1 or less ;) well stop it
i have been able to maintain my weight at 120 lbs and my last a1c was 6.8
however at the clinic i was getting consistent direction such as:   glucose targets:  prior to your meal to be between 4-7 2 hrs after your meal to be between 5-10 (but not more than 3 over my pre-mail reading) a1c target of less than 7   i recently was blessed to find a doctor but he now tells me that my before and after meal readings should be the same
my a1c was at 7.1 on my last test and he said this was 'alarmingly high" which to me seemed a bit overboard
so i started to research every med i am on and low and behold the statin now has warnings about causing bg's (a1c) to climb higher and they cause liver function tests to show a level 3 times higher than normal
anxious to see my next a1c and liver panel my gp put me on statins back in the 1990's and my endo increased my dosage from 20 mg to 40 mg of simvastatin back in 2010&hellip;not because i have cardiac issues but because, as diabetics, we are more at risk for cardiac complications
luckily, i have had no issues with the statins or the lisinopril and have been able to maintain my a1c's in the 6's except for a few low 7's in 2010 before i started using an insulin pump
my last a1c was 6.6
my hgb a1c in 11.2,  unbelievable,  so i have an appt in about a hour with the diabetes center to learn all this
from another caring soul, pat roth i have been the same road as you an now my a1c is just over 6 now
my sugars never run high but when i was diagnosed it was 282 and my a1c was 6.7 every time i check it's normal
my a1c for the pass twelve months has been a 6
as i understand it an a1c is an average over a 3 month period
if one had many spikes, and a good a1c, then that means one would have corresponding lows to make up for the highs jayabee52&mdash;that is the exact explanation that my endocrinologist gave me
i got my hba1c from 108 down to 80 and i felt amazing
i generally run a little high, always have and my a1c's are in the 5-7 range
my last a1c was 6.1 and i find that recording has helped me lower and keep my numbers down
a1c &lt; 7.0 pre-meal 70-130 post meal (2 hours post) &lt; 180 between 80 and 150 is what my doctors have always told me and is what i have read in all the books i had a discussion with my endo last week when i went in
his last a1c for 10.3, not good at all
we get his eyes checked, his a1c done every 3 months, learn everything we can online
my a1c is 6.6 at my highest
since the a1c is an average of your blood glucose ("bg") numbers over 90 days, there is no way to affect your a1c quickly except to do a very dangerous thing which i would not recommend:  keep your bg numbers below "normal" range deliberately
that eating regimen along with excercise has dropped my a1c from 6.9 to 5.5 in a matter of months
who know what to do in those situations my a1c was 11.1 in october 2010, i am preparing for gastric bypass surgery soon
my last a1c lst month was 7.3
my a1c was almost 14
to sweet, i know 7.2 sounds so very high to you, but as kevin  said, when he was diagnosed he had an a1c of 14
i was diagnosed last year with an a1c of 14.1 fasting blood sugar of 366
i changed the way i eat and my last a1c was 5.4
assuming you maintain control of your a1c in the 6's, the thing i have been doing to maintain foot care is to exercise those feet
my a1c level test (you'll know about that in 3 months) was a 6.4 so the doctor was happy
at the time my husband was diagnosed, his a1c was 5.8 and he was off all diabetes medications
tml english this seems to be the most recent conversion chart for comparing our average blood sugar level with the corresponding a1c &hellip;a1c(%)&hellip;blood sugar av
a1c 7 154)
ince i am from medical background   also logically keep in mind that the a1c is average of 3 months
so my a1c came back as 13.9 (yikes) and i apparantly flunked the t2 test
i'm happy to tell everyone that even though my a1c (which used to mean nothing to me) is still 7.5,  i'm healthy
my doctor was watching my bloodsugar for years&hellip;i would get fasting readings around 107&hellip;and a1c readings around 6.3&hellip;and it just seemed to me that my doctor was being an alarmist&hellip;so i ran on the high side of normal, big whoop, right
i am now seeing a specialist because my blood sugars are very seldom under 319 and my a1c just came back 11.9 i am totally scared but am doing my best and was looking for some friends when i came across your post
keeping it below a1c of 6.5-7.0 is supposed to help keeping it from getting worse and some people believe that getting your blood sugar to normal levels will even help reverse it a little
that is when i will know what my a1c will be at that time , but last month it was 6.8 so i just don't know what to do at this point
i was diagnoised as t1 6 months ago and my hba1c was 12.5 and depend on insulin mrng and night
on arrival, bp of 234/114, bg of 235, very dehydrated, hgba1c of 11.4&hellip;first and last admission to icu with dka
i have lost 26lbs now and my a1c went from 7.6 in mid dec
an a1c of 170 is not what you mean, i think
i am not sure someone would be alive with an a1c of 170
he may be reporting what his a1c indicates for average bg rather than the actual a1c number
my a1c count was 7 exactly&hellip; i was amazed
my a1c back in april was 8.8 will find out when i get back where i am now
yes, my a1c so far has remained steady at 5.7 as long as i eat properly
my a1c is still at 5.6 (sept
my a1c was 5.5 at that time
my a1c is 14.5 and is trying to get mys down
or, 81/2 more times with this result and your a1c will be 0 lol
i thought i was doing good but my tests say other wise my hemo a1c was 11.1 and my fasting level  was 422 when i went so apparently my meds are not working
its fiction   this is what i have found that helped me control my blood sugar   feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
pls help i am pre diabetic with a1c 5.6 thank u everyone i am a korean and hard to understand of how bad is pre diabetic i do nit have insurance si i an doing this by local clinic anyway thank u again everyone pre-diabetes means you have to take care of yourself so it doesn't get worse and become diabetes
my latest a1c was 5.8, just a little above yours
that morning, i had a hba1c of 12.2%, and an islet cell ab test showing positive
recently i had a full pathology test, which shows my hba1c of 5.8%, but what is really interesting is my islet cell ab test now shows as negative
praying for improved health for us all   james   btw the test you to which you refer about the glucose levels for the past 3 mo, is called a "glycosated hemoglobin a1c" test, often abbreviated to "a1c" thank you :)
tml english i just bought the a1c test from walmart for 9$, thinking i would have to send more money with the test&hellip;but i did not, it is just what you pay for the kit
i had my blood test from my dr and the walmart test was accurate thanks a lot&hellip;i didn't know walmart had the a1c test&hellip;i was looking for the kit and i found a site that would have cost me a lot of money &hellip;so i just gave up on finding me a kit&hellip;i will be @ walmart's very soon&hellip;i'm very happy i found this site&hellip;you can learn so much&hellip; i had my a1c done at the veteran's hospital yesterday
low carb-it, measure often and exercise&hellip;a1c in the 6"&mdash;no higher or lower
my a1c is in the mid 6 range and have been keeping it under control
my sugars are wonderful, my a1c was 5.4 and life is good but ever watchful and very mindful of my blessings of good health again
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
now i am eating lima beans and my sugar is really good the beans stop the sugar from attaching to the red blood cells i am still taking the milk thistle and eating the abc' s at least once a day and a fig leaf when i can get them my a1c was 6.1 and 89 for my last test i am hoping the next one will be below 5.8 this is so great
yes when found out that i was diabetic my a1c was 12.1 but had it tested in june and it was 6.1
my a1c was 6;5 until i got sick and it went up to 6.9
my a1c went from 14.9 down to 8.8
tml english ive been fighting this for 10 years now my last a1c was 10 yikes now i'm on 2 insulin and pills i have no insurance so this is really tough i'm an emotional eater and i'm not talking celery and carrot sticks my husband is a junk food junkie very much cakes cookies pie ect&hellip; he understands but isn't willing to not bring it in the house i'm feeling so alone in this that has to be tough
my first a1c was 9.0 my last one was 6.7
i'm now up to 119 pounds and my a1c went from 6.5 last may to 5.7 in december
i feel lucky that my a1c had only gotten up to 6.5 in my first year
i am trying to get my a1c below 6
getting your a1c below 6 may or may not greatly improve your overall health &hellip; but sticking to a healthy "diet" and lifestyle absolutely will
can't believe it when i got my a1c from a 10 to 6.2 in just 3 months with diet and exercise
my last a1c is 5.5, and i lost about 50 lbs as well
i too had a a1c of 12.5 back in feb and managed to bring it down to 6.0 with diet and exercise
when i took my a1c it was 12.0 then after it showed 9.0 i'm still trying i even started taking chia seed and have to take an a1c in february i hope its gotten better as soon as i was diagnosed i made up my mind that things were going to change
a1c shows your average levels over the last 90 days or so
am maintaining at borderline a1c at 6.0 right now down from 6.3 6mths ago
there is a bit of a correlation, but really the meters and the a1c are measurng 2 different things
if you have taken your bgs during the day time and averaged them, and then you had lows overnight, the a1c may not come anywhere close to the averages on your meter because your a1c recorded your lows as well as your highs
popcorn as a night snack, ehhh, there might be better options, but if your a1c reflects you 110mg/dl 90 day average as accurate, you're looking at an a1c of under 6, which is pretty stellar in my book
i am not perfect, and i also have celiac disease, which makes it a juggling act to eat, but i am under control, and my a1c stays well under 7
a1c: 6.2 but my ldl is high, so now i get to add a statin to the fistful of pills i take every day
my sugar was 550 at the start &amp; my a1c was 10.3   now my average a1c is 5.3   best wishes
have a beautiful day  *hugs*   cheryl i was diagnosed feb 2009 with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
by following my diet my blood sugar approach almost normal numbers in abut 4-6 weeks and my a1c dropped to 5.9 in 4 months
my latest a1c was 5.2
even though my a1c was 4.8, i started  prevention measures like to exercice and have a healthy food because i know we only live once
i was first diagnosed in mid-august 2011&hellip;fasting bg was 356 and a1c was 13.1 and cholesterol numbers were all too high
and yes my doc gave me meds&hellip;but not for the cholesterol (i flat out refused)&hellip;actosplusmetformin 15/500 2xdaily&hellip;well at my 90 day checkup&hellip;fasting bg was 125, a1c was 7 and cholesterol numbers dropped almost 40%-hdl back in normal range and ldl not far behind
my a1c came down from 8.1 to 7.8
this past january my a1c was 13.8&hellip; last week it was 4.9
great control with hba1c"s running 6.1 to 6.3
i have and i have used others to help, and i brought my a1c from 16 to 5,6 after using herbs and spices, like ,thyme,rosemary,garlic ,cloves,cinnamon,bay leaves,ginger,the most rare spice is saffron,saffron is used throughout the mediterranean in local dishes like french bouillabaisse, spanish paella and milanese risotto
my a1c's are mid-6's
my a1c was 8.9 and the last one i did was 8.7
i have only been keeping a good look at my sugars for the past month or so, but still&hellip;my a1c was 8.7 - might as well say 9
i guess i need to take baby steps, but i'd like for my next a1c to be no higher than 6 - of course 5 would be fan-freakin-tastic
tml english my a1c went from a 7.7 to a 6.5
tml english my first a1c being diagnosed this summer was 17%
second a1c 6.5%
my last a1c was 6.2- if you aren't on any meds, you could try herbs to help bring it down
i have lost 60 pounds and my a1c is usually between 6.0 - 6.3 which the doctor says is wonderful
my a1c at last testing in december was 13
i have learned what to ask my endo, i am eating better, my a1c is 5.2 instead of 12.8
have a a1c check every three months 3
i'm actually about to get off medication because my a1c has been around 5.4 the last two times and i have lost almost 60 lbs

tml english the diabetes mellitus interagency coordinating committee (dmicc) met in march 2011 to discuss the use of the a1c test for diabetes and in august 2011 to discuss federal agency diabetes guides and guidelines
however now that i am using the vet health, and seeing my a1c at 7.3, my new pcp just put me back on metformin 500mg; one am &amp; one pm
in the first 3 months, my a1c went from 8.8 to 6.8
the hba1c test gives you a reading of your average blood sugar over the past 3 months
he will run the a1c test every 3 mo
(or mine does) and this determines from dr if i can maintain control with a1c reading under 7&hellip;or if higher, may put on pills or insulin
ast a1c in july was 8.1 i've heard this called the dawn phenomenon (i have no idea if i spelled that right, but i'm too lazy to check right now&hellip;lol)
my last a1c was 10.7&hellip;and i just had it done last week again and now it's 6.4 (pat myself on the back)
besides, a1c tests average out your levels for the past 6 months
my a1cs have been in the 9 and 10s for the last year or so
my a1c was 5.5 in may 2011 and even though i hadn't even considered the possibility, weight loss came as a positive side effect
when i was diagnosed with type 2 in late april, i weighed 225 &amp; my a1c was 8.1
14612-is-a-a1c-of-9-to-high-to-get-a-diabetic-medical-alert-tattoo
however my a1c is a 9 which for me is awesome
i am very proud to have finally gotten my a1c from a 12 to a 9
i really think that the tattoo would be a great idea but i am worried that a a1c of 9 is still to high to get a tattoo
my a1c is is 11 i took extra care making sure to maintain it clean and dry
he says an a1c over 9 is a no but if you could drop it just a little an 8 would be good
even though your diabetes is out of control you should always have an alert on you, you will never became a non diabetic even if you manage to get your a1c down to 5
my levels are in the 100-250 range at this stage, but were much higher before diagnosed (a1c of 14)e
y last four a1c were 5.4,5.4,5.4,and5.5
y/whyfast ) my short term goal is to get my a1c to 5.6 or less (currently 5.7) and to do that i need to keep my blood glucose levels to as close to "normal" as possible
tml english i'm so excited, today my blood results came in, and my a1c is 6.8, 3 months ago it was 12.9, last month it dropped to 7.9 and now 6.8
i also have been coaching a friend who is on a pump, her a1c was 12.9 before i helped her and hers went down to 9.2, so she is so happy
not at all,his a1c's have all been above 10 and its because he wi not take it seriously
the doctors have no other explanation for how i can manage (my a1c goes between 5.5 and 6.4) with so little insulin except that i must still be in the honeymoon phase
thanks,   my last 3 a1c's have all been below 6.0
and my neighbor's son not deciding to play his brand new drum set while i am relaxing on the sofa enjoying the quiet&hellip; getting my a1c down to 6.4 and waking up with 85 in the morning
my a1c went from 6 before meds to 6.5 after meds
by making changes in my diet, i have been able to lower my a1c from 2 years ago and it is also near normal
you're obviously a transitioning type 2 diabetic and you have to focus on the things that will keep you a1c in the 6's
my a1c is in the 6s
since 6.5 is a good a1c and you were at 6.0 without the meds, if i were you i would question why i was told to take meds in the first place
i have done a lot of reading and my a1c is pretty dang good even in reference of where they want it&hellip;to answer your question i was diagnosed with type 2
the only thing that went up is my a1c from 6 to 6.5
agreeing with james&hellip;   and to have an a1c of 6.5 is absolutely awesome
i lost 65 lbs on a high protein/low carb meal plan, got off my diabetes meds and had an a1c of 5.5
a1c dropped from 7.1  to 5.8
my a1c was 13.3 and is currently a 7
my a1c was 13.3 and is currently a 7
my a1c went from 8 to 9 during the year i had the pump
myself my a1c with mdi went from 8 to 6.4 in 3 months
my a1c was a 7.0 before i started using the pump now it's 8.10
my last a1c was 6.2 and that is the best i have ever seen
i went from a 11 a1c to a 5.5 a1c in 4 months
if you can keep your a1c in the 6's, then you're fine
she is checking for kidney problems, hypoglycemic agent, a comprehensive metabolic panel, cortisol, a1c, insulin, testosterone, t-4, tsh, c-peptide, and insulin antibody
my a1c has gone from 6.5 in october to 7.8 today
this is what i did and my a1c went from 14.1 to 5.9 in 4 months and has remained below 6.0 ever since
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
so far i haven't been on meds for mine - my last a1c was 6.1, just a couple of weeks ago
i have lost about 65 lbs over the course of a year, and have had an a1c of 5.5
yet when she had an a1c done once, she had an a1c of 6.0%  her endo guessed it was because she had lows just prior to the drawing of blood for the a1c
that you could post a number as high as 500 yet have a "normal" a1c is odd to say the least   steve the 500 was a finger prick
i was in for a regular endo check today and my a1c level was 5.4
when i was taking lantus at night it would hold me through the night and my readings were always 150 or below but my a1c would still be 8.4
my last a1c was 5.5 and i lost about 50 lbs
my a1c was 5.3 and 5.2 during pregnancy,which i contribute to testing 10-12 times a day and a cgm
i am type 1 as well and my a1c went from 7 something into the 5.6 range after getting on my pump
now my avg fasting bs is 106  my a1c is 5.9  my three month bs avg is 123, a good 5o points below what is was before insulin my doctor said something about this also but i told him if i have to go on a med
i had kinda been expecting it for years, my previous doctor in pennsylvania had been monitoring my blood sugar for years&hellip;i would run fasting readings of 107-109&hellip;and a1c's in the 6.1 - 6.3 range
i limit myself to 120 grams of carb per day and have been able to keep my hba1c in the 6's, indicating good control for a person with diabetes
an average of 107 in itself is good and if consistent over 3 months, your a1c would be in the 5's which is excellent but it would be better without the low readings in the 60's
as for my bs, they are pretty well under control; my latest a1c was 6.0
my a1c was 10.8
i just had my three month check-up and my a1c has dropped to 6.9 and i know that a huge part of it was all of the advice and knowledge i reamed from this forum
my diabetic nurse and my (pcp) primary care physician is very proud of my progress  i have managed to bring my a1c levels from a 9.9 in january 2014 down to a 5.0  in 7 months now here in october
for a long time now my readings have been in the 400;s and my a1c was 11 two months ago
tml english i just got the results from my friday labs and my new a1c is 6
insulin took be from 10 a1c to 7 and i still am working at it
tml english i got my a1c yesterday after about 6 months into the pump
my a1c is down to 7.3 and like you, i am having mental awareness like never before
in early 2013 my a1c was 7.7
tml english ok so when i was diagnosed in september with a a1c of 12.7&hellip;so i just got it checked the other day (after badgering my dr&hellip;different story), i got the results today&hellip;its still 9.2
just think, if you dropped 3 points this go, by your next a1c you might just be at 6
when i was diagnosed in december my a1c was 13.9
i did the mail away a1c and it came back at 5.9, i also wound back up in the hospital around the same time and my a1c was 5.7
you a1c needs to be below 7.0
you need to get your a1c into the 6's sooner rather than later to avoid the potential onset of complications
a normal ha1c is 4.5 so you're a tad off the mark right now
when diagnosed in june 2009 my a1c was 13.0 and my glucose was 326
lou, a1c of 6 is really good imo yes it is but i want it a bit lower
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
i was diagnosed in dec and my a1c was 13.3 and in jan 10.0 this month it is down to 7.4 on a non fasting test
seemed to think 6.8 a1c was good, and fasting bs of 145 was fine
i've lost 75 lbs dropped my a1c to 5.9
i have found that i do not go "hypo" and i have set my targeted bgl's and a1c low so in order to do that i stay between 50 and 100 carbs per day (closer to 50 more often than not) you need to determine how aggressively you want to (safely) deal with diabetes and then plan your "diet" accordingly   namaste -steve thank you i need to lose about 70 lbs and i am having a problem sticking to a diet
i got my hba1c on saturday and i was dredding going, it was 14.3, highest it's been since diagnosed 5ish years ago, at the same time i've never had particularly good bloods being diagnosed in my late teens finding it hard to fit in but since getting my a1c on saturday im proud to say my bloods haven't been about 10 once since and are averaging quite well
my hba1c was 6.2 yea
always the answer is the same: keep the a1c "under control" (mine is 5.5), and and the blood pressure within normal limits (mine is 110/65)
my a1c went from 5.7 to 7.8
for over a year and a half, i have had trouble controlling my blood best a1c was 6.8
i had to stop the insulin because of the lows and my a1c was 5.8
he promised to be my friend for life if i kept my a1c at my current 5.5
well - i finally got my lab results back from this visit and i am excited to report that my a1c is @ 6.2 which is down from 9.4 three months ago
i can tolerate a total of 115 grams of carb daily, maintain my weight and my last hba1c was 6.9 but i expect the next one to be a bit lower
tml english my a1c is only 5.7 but i know my glucose spikes quite high after eating, even a couple hours afterward
when i went into the hospital my a1c was 17% and my sugar was at 800
my a1c yesterday was 10.1
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
my a1c has remained below 6 for 2 years now
and i actually got off the meds&hellip;i got my a1c to 5.8 with diet and exercise
i continued the meds and had labs done and my a1c jumped to 8.0
i have done really well and 3 months ago my a1c was down 5.8
just an fyi - hba1c was 6.4 (not bad) and glucose serumn 150
as long as her a1c is at or below 6 it is good
i went for a physical but they wanted to do my a1c test so they did and it was about 6 months ago when i had my last one and that one was 6.1 and my one from today was 5.4 and i was so happy and i have lost 14 pounds and i am so proud of myself and i would like to thank everyone who has inspired me to want to get on track and live a great life and i am continuing to lose weight so i can be skinny so i can meet my inspiration and hero justin drew bieber
congrats on a low a1c congrats on the great a1c and losing eight
a1c was 5.9 and my blood sugar was not too high
my last a1c had me at 6.7 with blood sugar of 117
my a1c would go up .1 or .2 every 3-6 months
y a1c has always been in  the 6 range
my a1c dropped from 11.4 (really bad) to 5.6
my a1c is 12.2 so it's really high
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
tml english just got my a1c &hellip; 6.4
you have to be your own doctor because here in michiganmy wife's a1c was 15.0 and they did nothing me personally i recommend insulin pumps for diabetics and in some cases a continous glucose monatoring system my wife is on the dexcom cgms trial only right now and it does seem to work more poking in the begining but later less poking yea any questions please reply or  calebsemme2003@yahoo
my new a1c is 5.5 which is awesome
in may i had an a1c of 17
well my a1c was 11 the doc visit before that it was 9 so it went up
my a1c was 10.9%
:) danni thanks theladyiscrazy   i was diagnosed last year with a a1c of 14.1 fasting blood sugar 366
a1c went to 5.9   4 months later
sometimes i want to bring them to my diabetes classes so they can know what they think they know&hellip;because of these folks my a1c was at 13
my a1c is at 7.9
i watch my intake of foods pretty carefully (my a1c is 5%) but i'm still gaining weight
my a1c is good, but my triglycerides are really, really bad&hellip;490
a1c is about a 9 so that is also an issue
get a1c down to a normal level&hellip;took 1 year, last one was 5.5
a1c went from 14.1 to 5.9 in about 4 months
my a1c has remained below 6.0 for the last year and a half
hopefully testing and your doc can clear a1c compiles about 3 months of blood sugar results
irst off my a1c went from 6.6 to 5.9 witch i think is good but they told me my triglycerides are alittle high so i need to get on meds for that right away
i try hard to keep my blood levels on the good side and in the last year have gone (was using the pump) a1c of 11 at the best to now i'm at 7 so to me i want to party with a big peice of caake and ice cream with whip cream (hummmm) i get up every day and start with coffee and the obits if my name is not there im ready to have a wonderful day
then he told me he wanted to take blood tests and that was one thing the night before i didn't study for so i new i failed but my a1c was 7.6 for me that is great usualy up to a year ago was 11 to 14 and i was on a pump then he told me it was problems with my parkinsons tremor iwas taking to much or not enough insulin so he put me on a pen
i raised my a1c by 1 whole point just by stress
i am 5'3" at 120 lbs with last a1c 6.3
my last a1c was 6.7
an a1c covers about 90 days, so one or two meals won't make much of a dent, but it is a good indicator if you've taken a few too many free meals
the entire 20 years that i have had diabetes, my a1c has always hovered around 6.0 +/= a  tenth of a point or two
my first a1c was 16 - 3 months later it was 7
fell off big time went from a1c of 7 to 10 in 6 months
i just had a recheck on my a1c&hellip;it is 7.1 (same as it was in april of this year)
if you stay in tune with diet and exercise you will see a difference&hellip;debe well kruss i take the same amount of metformin as you do, but to control my bs better i am on insulin also my last two a1c was 5.4
my a1c went from 15.2 to 6.5 in six months using insulin
i have been working out with a great friend who is more like a personal trainer for the last six weeks or so which i am guessing kept my a1c from rising&hellip;wasnt exercising before 8/1/09
my main worry is with my a1c being 7.1 that she'll switch up my meds and that is the scary part for me because a1c is supposed to be under 7.0
i was so mad at myself that i feel like i may have messed up my wonderful a1c of 5.4 , does anyone else ever have splurges
i am a very very very lonely diabetic, searching for a friend who can relate to these things&hellip;most people i have read and had some conversations with are type 2, and i'm type 1, but a very rare case type 1&hellip;i'm honeymooning, which actually comes with several lows, then, when i go high, i'm in the 500s, 600s, and 300s&hellip;averages to about 380-440 range&hellip;god, i am not swearing, but i am exhausted, my a1c was actually low&mdash;&mdash;-for a long long time&hellip;for a whole 7 years&hellip;i almost died, and had to have my heart shocked back at age 35 from metformin&hellip;turns out they found i am allergic to the metformin itself&hellip;my sugar went from the 50s on that up to 701 , and insulin worked beautifully&hellip;because of internal bleeding from peptic ulcers, i cannot take insulin right now, as it would not be good, because with internal bleeding, blood sugars drop&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;so, insulin is not for me on a regular basis ( i've tried to stay off of it) until i continue to take care of my belly and get more calories in at night&hellip;oh, somebody&hellip;sorry to sound negative, i am a positive person, but, i am tired, i just lost 2 nights sleep this week from blood sugars in the 300s and 400s and urinating all night long&hellip;is there anybody on this site that can relate to this type of type 1
good news was my a1c which was 10.4 three months ago, and an eye doc said to bring it down 1 point by dec
i did really well for  a few years - kept my a1c to 5.6 and was fine
my last a1c was 6.9 and i'm trying to improve that&hellip;need to exercise more regularly and maybe curtail some of the carbs
and have diabetes skipping through their family like fairies sprinkling dust&hellip;they have a normal a1c&hellip;we should do what ever we can to focus on overall health&hellip;and pray to our creator&hellip;it is enough&hellip; did you really mean to cite an hba1c of 70 mmol/mol in your example of risk&hellip;that would indicate astronomical bg's&hellip;perhaps a decimal was omitted
i'm not sure the hba1c scale even goes as high as 70
an hba1c of 70 mmol/mol is equal to an hba1c of 8.6% &hellip; it's "euro speak"    http://www
i had referred to my copy of gary scheiner's book "think like a pancreas" where an hba1c of 7 equated to an 8.3 avg mmol or 150avg mg/dl
a1c 6.0 most 90 day checks
my numbers were high and a1c was 8.6 again so i have been put on lantus anyone on it can you tell me if it makes your sugar drop too fast or if it works slowly&hellip;i fear dropping too fast lantus is a long-acting insulin that is designed to lower blood sugar levels over a 24-hour period
that my sugar a1c has gone back up again and at this time it is at 8.5 and now i have to write down everything i eat each and every day so starting this month i am not only going to be posting my bg numbers but also my eats and the times i eat them
my a1c only went from 7.4 to 7.3, so i know that feeling
my a1c used to be below 6; now it's 7.5
tml english i was diagnosed as a type 2 diabetic after blood work on may 29th (a1c was 11.8%) just got my lab results back last week from blood work done on august 28th (a1c was 6.8%)   my primary form of reduction: diet: around 50 complex carbs per day supplements: chromium 1,000 mcg, cinnamon: 1,000 mg exercise: 1 mile a day weight before: 185lbs, 3 months later 170lbs (height: 6')   thought i would share my first blood test results since being diagnosed that's really great michael
you said your a1c was 6.5 that means your average bs was 135
my last a1c was 6.5
8, 2010   a1c 13.5                                              2
2010    a1c  6.5                                            3
june 8, 2011   a1c  5.0 you go girl thanks congratulations
taking cymbalta may have even caused the diabetes but i hope my next a1c is better than 7.2 which my dr didn't think was bad
a1c was almost 8
a1c dropped to 6.4
unfortunately my numbers are climbing again, and a1c 3 weeks ago was 7.2
tells me that i have to drop my a1c when its below 6.0 and my sugar at fasting or when i wake is less than 130 and i have been known to drop from 106 to 65 and that is when my head hurts meaning i have dropped to low
when i found out that i had diabetes in may, my a1c was 14
i started riding my bike and doing my workout besides watching my carbs and when they tested my a1c two months later, it was at 9
my a1c's have been in the 5.4-6.4 range for almost 10 years, but when i have too many highs and lows, my sd is higher and i can feel the neuropathy symptoms in my left foot
i had a1c's no higher than 6.1 for almost 10 years, but had the beginning stages of neuropathy and retinopathy
within 6 months of diagnosis my a1c was 6.1 and has been under 6.0 ever since then
i also realize that even with an a1c of 5.3 i may still suffer any one of the nasty effects that diabetes may bring
my a1c runs under 7 (6.7 last) which requires my blood sugar to be between 80 and 180&mdash;my target
checked for it and the highest my a1c has been 7.5 and dr jumped on that real fast
i've been a diabetic for over 25 yrs and my a1c reached 14.7, yours will drop as you follow your program
pr at diagnoses my a1c was 14.9
at the next check my a1c was 5
i am new and taking byetta my a1c was 9.7 on my first one
i too started out at an extremely high a1c 13.5
i meant to say that my a1c was 13.9&hellip;just came out wrong
my most recent a1c was 5.6 wow
my last a1c was 5.4
my carbs are kept so low my a1c was only 5.5 last month
my carbs are kept so low my a1c was only 5.5 last month
my carbs are kept so low my a1c was only 5.5 last month
my carbs are kept so low my a1c was only 5.5 last month
my carbs are kept so low my a1c was only 5.5 last month
i had bloodwork done and my a1c level is down from an 8 to a 6
my a1c was over 11 five months ago
because of advice here i was able to get my a1c down in the 6% range even without the doctors and the meds
a1c 7.1  started monitoring after, bgsi, went from 160 to 130 to aprox 100 to 125, with diet and exercise (no meds) then i slipped of the diet, stopped the gym due to work constraints,woke up one mng last week, left hand numb and painful, and always tired and sluggish,  took reading 1 hr pp 203 1 min later 180  2hrs 122
a1c was 11.3 at last test, going for next round this week
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
my a1c has remained below 6 for 2 years now
my a1c went from 14.1 to 5.6 in about 8 or 9 months
my a1c went down to 5.4 back in september
i like lantus but the swelling uggh and the numbers but my a1c in a month and a week from 14.9 to 10.4 to 8.2
i have been on insulin since my diagnosis oct 2010 and i think im doing alright i mean my a1c is down to 5.7 which to me is next to amazing
eat only  100% whole wheat bread  whole grain rice,wheat pastas i really watch all the carbs i put into my body and my a1c is now 5.9 i only eat 40 to 50 g carbs per meal sometimes even less
i have had type 2 for 25 years and am in good health with a1c at 5.8
my doc told me i was "borderline" high with an a1c of 7.6 and the only advice he offered was to watch what i eat &amp; test twice a day
if her a1c is 4.9 that is not a danger at this point
the a1c is the average of blood glucose over a three month period (comparison mine = 6.4)
my last a1c was 5.6 and in one month i get tested so we will see how they work
i have lowered my a1c from 7.2 to 6.3 and have had better bs readings
my last a1c came back at 5.4 so i must be doing something right, much to my own surprise
my last time was 180 but it had been 150 the month before that and my a1c is at 7.9 it didn't go up at all i guess that must be good, right
tml english in one month my a1c drop from 11.7 to 7.7 blood sugar stays around 140 my dr
thinks my a1c is hight from a reaction from my spinal shots go again in two months for another a1c than in tree months after that that is great improvement
a1c is usually a measure of 2 to 3 months worth of bg's&hellip;so, if you stay around 140 for your bg's, your a1c might actually be in the high 6's or low 7's in another month
tml english going to my first a1c follow-up on monday&hellip;feeling a bit anxious, hoping  for good news&hellip; i would like to say that in 12 weeks my a1c went from 10 to 7.1
for your a1c, anything in the 6's is good
my a1c was 5.9&hellip; great job gennie
four months ago when i was diagnosed my a1c was 8.7 this week it was 6.6, of course i need more ideasnas to how to lower it even more
i also don't aim too low with the a1c, under 7 is good enough
y last a1c was 9.8
i have kept my bg levels between 80 to 130 mg/dl, achieved an a1c of 5.5%, and lost 65 lbs over 5 months
i have found that by limiting my carbs to no more than 120 total grams of carb per day, i am able to maintain my 120 pound weight and my last a1c was 6.8
after i receive your study materials, i will send your a1c results and a $10 gift card to thank you for being in my study
had a1c test 2 weeks ago & was 7.2 % which made me happy still have work to do just have to eat right & exercise more i gave up all kinds of junk food
my previous a1c was about 6.8 or so
(which at the time i thought was great)  but my a1c in may was 5.5
and my a1c was 6.7  and fasting bs was 119 when my pcp diagnosed me
i'm 65 now and my last a1c was 6.7, and, other than my diabetes, i consider myself quite "healthy"
this comes from my own experience, since then i've added safe carbs, balancing my meals and last a1c was 6.2 last week
on that plan i kept my bg close to the normal range, had an a1c of 5.5, and as an added bonus, i lost about 50 lbs from feb 2011 till now
my last a1c was  5.3
by doing that i was able to keep my bg levels in the 80 to 130 mg/dl, achieve an a1c of 5.5%, lose 65 lbs over 5 mo
and considering my last a1c was an 11.4 and now my own random check resulted in a 135
my last hgba1c was 11.4 also just last week when i was admitted to the icu with dka
i couldn't get her to stop and hear that my a1c was and remains 5.4, and that i have problems with hypoglycemia, not highs - it is extremely unlikely that i am going to be having those kinds of complications as long as i continue with the pattern i've established
tha carb counting is the best way for us to keep her ha1c under 14
i was able to get my a1c down to 5.9 by eliminating carbs some years ago&hellip;am striving to get back to that level after relaxing my carb intake standards
if you are looking for meal planning advice (aka"diet" tips) i had used this meal plan to control my blood glucose, lower my a1c to 5.5 and lose 65 lbs
my a1c have been in the high 5 and low 6's for years
reduced carb intake had enabled me to keep my a1c below 7.0, keep my weight stable at 120 pounds, and prevent me from developing debilitating diabetes complications after 39 years with this disease
i got my a1c down to 5.1 - 5.7 ever sent then
now, today i see the doc and they take my a1c and it is at 7.1
i go to the doctor thursday and i know my a1c is going to be 10 or higher because i have not been eating like i should
i sprinkle on cinnamon only and eat as my breakfast or a light lunch&hellip;i still fight my weight battles, but i am better than before and best of all my a1c last month was 6.5&hellip;stick with this site and never give up kats49 when were you diagnosed
even with type 2: my boss - who is not obese, eats low carbs and is extremely active - still has to take a small amount of metformin to keep his a1c at 5.3
your friend always; edie good a1c congrats edie keep up the good work   jackie it was so cool this morning, even the dogs didn&#39;t wake me up for breakfast
u,rndom 8.2        0.0-17.0 microalb/creat ratio  3.3       0.0-30.0   hemoglobin a1c      6.5         59    60-128   this is better than i had hoped for
tml english hey, have a question for everyone:  how do you help a spouse who has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes( like diagnosed today) his labs showed all was good but his a1c was 6.5 which isnt good
in the 6 weeks since i have been out my a1c is at a 13.6
i jumped for joy when my a1c got to 6.5
an a1c of 6.5
thanks  donna i just found out my a1c was 12.5 in august, i think i am probably due for another one soon
i suspect that donna (diva) is living in a country which uses the mmol/l mesurement   her numbers may look to us like a1c numbers but from the context of the original post i think those were not a1c readings
those sound like an a1c reading, which is a test that will tell you your average blood glucose levels for a 3 month period, and the test should only be given every 2 to 3 months
however, i seriously need to find my old a1c numbers, as they turned up missing, then, the metformin put me in what they call a low state for a long time , from mid 2005-late 2007
what is really crazy is my diabetes turned up in not the a1c so much as it did in another diabetic test, and i can't find the record of it now&hellip;it's very very very frustrating&mdash;&mdash;so, finally a really good clinic i go to now for my sleep meds found the record from 1996 about 3 months ago&mdash;-it was lost for a long time for some reason or another, so the doctors scratched their heads&hellip;understandable
when i was over half starved, my a1c was an 8, along with triglycerides of 150&mdash;&mdash;-for some reason or another&mdash;-something to do with my metabolism, my diabetes show up atrociously in one diabetic test, but not so much in the a1c
i have years of untreated childhood diabetes&mdash;&mdash;they said it probably started off as type 2 when i was born, then progressed to type 1&mdash;&mdash;i had diabetic seizures for years, but usually they would happen at night when i was sleeping&hellip;when i was 6 years old, my family doctor said my fasting was 160&mdash;-but he took a urine test the next year and the urine was spilled on the way to the doctor&mdash;&mdash;he said he had to start me on insulin if my urine output was way high, along with the 160 fasting, but, the urine turned in was only partial because it was spilled&mdash;&mdash;i was too young to answer his questions, so i got too shy on him&mdash;-i was extremely extremely shy as a child, and i told him i felt healthy&mdash;&mdash;-nothing could have been farthest from the truth&hellip;he scratched his head, said he repeatedly could smell so much sugar on  my breath it about knocked him over from age 4 on up&hellip;so, i will keep rapidly searching for a new internist, endocronologist&hellip;i"m getting closer&mdash;&mdash;-i was almost admitted for kedoacidosis 3 times in the last 4 years, but, my a1c shows low&mdash;&mdash;only 5.9, yet, everytime  i have been in the e
over the last 3 years, they took my sugar and it showed keytones almost every single time&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;i seriously need to find the other diabetic test where my diabetes showed up&mdash;-nothing is worse really, because that's a nondiabetic number&mdash;-a1c of 5.9&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;wierd, yes, but i was diagnosed diabetic without a doubt when i was 35&mdash;&mdash;in 2005
most peoples' show up in the a1c&hellip;so, when i go to talk to people, it's hard for me to talk about the a1c&mdash;&mdash;when i get enough to eat, my average fastings are 300-430 &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;when i don't have enough to eat, i have a diabetic seizure in the middle of the night&mdash;&mdash;-i now have enough to eat everyday now, though&hellip;so, i am trying to stabilize my after meals out more while searching for a new internist, as , i do not want to go blind or related&mdash;&mdash;thank you again&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;write me back if you have time&mdash;&mdash;my triglycerides were almost 500 3 months ago&mdash;&mdash;-my internist the last time said my a1c actually would double to around 16 if i had enough to eat everyday&mdash;-it's creeping up fast&mdash;real fast, but, even still , i need to find the record of the other diabetic test i had done&mdash;&mdash;sincerely, anne howdy degibu welcome to dc
this morning i woke up at 10.5 (using the canadian increments, just think of it as an a1c number or else multiply it by 18), took a correction, ate a small breakfast with an appropriate bolus, shot to 14.5 two hours later and did some gardening which dropped me to 2.3 (41)
my a1c this month was down 8.1 from 9.5 but i have no idea why
my last a1c was 6.1%
i will be getting the result for my latest a1c friday which, due to illness, will be in the 6.2% to 6.3%
did you know that having a a1c level of 7% and above, puts you, as a diabetic at risk for the following complications, and more:   eye disease, heart disease, kidney disease, neuropathy, nerve disease   the higher your blood glucose level is, the more damaging the effects of diabetes on your internal organs
~mays~ my last a1c in oct was 5.7
the main goal is to get your a1c in the 6's
:d feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
my a1c is 6.0
i have had a1c's in the 5's for the last 3 or 4 years
thanks&hellip;   mike wow i keep my a1c between 6 and 6.5 my doctor tells me thats great
normal a1c runs from about 4.8 through 5.5
my most recent a1c is 5.5, and i am doing the happy dance
mike, it sounds to me like you have been doing great if you have kept your a1cs in the 5s
my last a1c was 6.6
my a1c was 2.5
i just got my bloodwork back again after 6 months and a1c is 5.4
my a1c was not 2.5 (that isn't possible i don't think for anyone) it was 5.6 at first
also, there is no way of knowing if you caught the diabetes early unless you have a1c, fasting glucose and oral glucose tolerance tests every 3 months or so
im on 20 mg generic lipitor for over a year haven't had any change in blood sugars my a1c has stayed at 5.3 for well over a year:) great a1c's you are having
my issues are that i need to lose weight and get my a1c down to 6.8
i weight 220 and my last a1c was 8.1
my a1c was 5.2 back in oct of last year
my a1c raised to 7.2,  i was wondering if anyone else is on victoza and wanted to know what they think of it
thank you unicorn lady :)  i am definitely learning everyday&hellip;my goal is to learn as much as i can about my condition and continue to be able to manage with diet and exercise, i was able to get my a1c down from 11 at diagnosis to a 5.4 in 3 months &hellip;i do feel 100x better , i do feel deprived at times and hate having to watch my diet on a daily basis, but my energy is amazing now and i just need to realize that if i want to continue to feel this good , i need to take care of myself
had rescent blood work done&hellip;my a1c is 11.3
my last a1c was 6.6 up .4 from the visit before
my last a1c was 6.6 up .4 from the visit before
she said that my bg was up over 380 and my a1c was confirmed at 12.6
a1c is 6.4
keep up the good work your a1c will show you your average over 3 - 4 months,  that is a really good indicator how things are going for you
that morning my blood glucose (fasting) was 315 and my a1c was &gt;14
last month my a1c was 8.9 and today 7.3 (i purchased the at home tests)
while an a1c of 7.3 is certainly an improvement it still represents an average blood glucose level of about 170 which is way above the level that complications are known to occur
i was diagnosed 8 years ago and did not consider reducing metformin to 500 mg until my a1c dropped to 5.7
may i suggest an eating plan which i developed over 3 yrs ago on which i had discontinued my twice daily injections of nph insulin, kept my bg (blood glucose) levels at 80 to 130 mg/dl, achieved an a1c of 5.5% and lost 65 lbs over a 5 mo period
my a1c's have been below 6.0 for 8 years
lol his a1c is only 5.5
on a side note, it's impossible to say that your a1c is worse because of insulin if you only started it 2 weeks ago
tml english i am new to the board, just recently diagnosed with type 2 (may 29: a1c 11.8% and a 364 bg)
my daily routine is below: get up around 5:45 run/jog 3/4 mile check bg eat a fiber breakfast (english muffin w/peanut butter) morning snack around 10:30 (fiber one bar) salad for lunch snack around 4 high protein dinner evening jog check bg mild protein snack before dinner i developed neuropathy in my feet (bad enough i have issues walking) with an a1c under 6.0 &hellip; pretty sure i have never been "over 150 for a couple days"   steve a book that really helped me to understand what was going on in my body was gary scheiner's "think like a pancreas"
i was diagnosed at 317bg and 14%a1c june 26, 2014
tml english i had my a1c on tuesday, and it is 5.4 same was it was when i was first diagnosed
my bs numbers are good and my a1c number is still under 7, but has come up from 6.1 to 6.7
i have also raised my a1c target to high 6's instead of low 6's
a year and a half ago my memory loss hit it's worst and enough was enough resulting in me telling my doctors about what was going on, they put me on a pump instantly, my driving license was given up for 8 months and i'm glad to say i am now back on track with a hba1c  6.7 :) so i'm a very happy girl
again, i've only been doing this for a week so i don't figure there will be a drastic change in the beginning (it was 333 after fasting when my dr put me on meds) have a blessed day dear ngtowl,  have faith, i went from an a1c of 14.2 to 9 in only 6 weeks
i had an a1c of 16.1 and now i'm at 10.2 in 2 mo this
god has been good, in all these years my laziness has not caused any permanent damage as far as i can see&hellip; but with an a1c of 13&hellip;i won't be able to say that much longer&hellip; what type of doctor are you seeing
my a1c was 9.1
good luck   feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
this comment makes sense, that is why i am highly considring to go on insulin because my fbs runs 130-150 for the last yr but my a1c is still 6.9
today my a1c's have run in the 5.8 realm for the last year and a half
i've lost 60lbs and my a1c is as good as someone who doesn't have diabetes&hellip; and occasionally (3 times in 8 months) if i want a small fry or a kids burger i don't want anyone to tell me no
but a1c was 12.5 at that time and my c-peptide test showed 0.18ng/ml according to report which came put yesterday
when different health providers ask your a1c and you say 7.5 you get the tisk-tisk
my a1c was 7.1
my a1c is 5.2, i've lost 70 lbs and now excersise three times a week at my local ymca pool
tml english i went to the dr on monday and got back the results today&hellip; a1c is 5.8 instead of 13.2 (like at april 2013 diagnosis)
bringing down your a1c suggests to me that you've been dealing with your t2 pretty successfully with the drs you currently have
i take 500 mgs once a day and my a1c is 6.9
my a1c is 5
in spite of the hypos my last a1c went from 7.6 to 8.3
i feel i'm in the same boat as temperance&hellip;i'm horrible at this, and while my a1c has come down since diagnosis, it's not that low yet, and my numbers are still always high (200/300's)
i spoke to my doctor and he said that although my numbers are good, (a1c 5.0) he wants me to take the metformin to help my pancreas and slow down the inevitable complications as diabetes progresses
when i finally got in to see a doctor at the nashville va a year after moving to tn, their blood tests indicated that my a1c was 11.7 and my blood sugar was 347
by cutting out the regular coke, sunny d and other high carb foods, my next a1c was 5.9 and my blood sugar was in the 80s
had the usual high initial glucose reading and the follow-up fasting blood work showed ha1c of 8.7 with fasting glucose at 147
rafter meeting with my healthcare providers diabetes counselor for the first time, on june 4,  i was given the usual targets to meet (try to get a1c below 7.0, keep glucose hello and welcome
i limit myself to 120 grams of carb per day which allows me to maintain my weight around 120 lbs and my last a1c was 6.8
i have a meal plan (i despise the word "diet") which i developed where i manage my bg (blood glucose) levels in the normal ranges, had an a1c of 5.5, and over the course of 5 months lost 65 lbs
i want to lower my a1c have been at 6.5 got a year
i will be the boss of my a1c, for the 1st time ever
i found it interesting that mine was well over 200, but less than 300, and my first a1c was 5.6 i think i topped out at 290
(sorry, i don't get on here much lately so i may have missed many of your posts) my first a1c was up over 8, close to 9
4340-a1c-6-but-diagnosed-as-not-diabetic
her bloodwork (non fasting) came back that her blood sugars were extremely high, they had her come back in for a fasting blood test,and her a1c was 6
is that possible, for someone to be not diabetic and still have an a1c of 6
my last a1c was 5.9, and i am still definitely a diabetic
i was told that if your a1c goes below 6 you are on your way to being a none diabetic
however, my a1c went down from 5.6 back then to 5.4 now
also, the a1c shows the average for the last 3 months
i obviously don't have all your gtt results or prior a1c (since presumably, this was your first a1c), but if you had consistently high bs, your a1c wouldn't have been less than 6
if you had bs around 271 all or most of the time after eating, you would have an a1c in the high 7's or into the 8's (sorry don't have my chart with me)
sheila a single random bs of 289 does not jive with an a1c of only 6
a diabetic with an a1c under 6 means you are in perfect control
i control bg with diet and exercise and my a1c's are always 5.4 (or so)
i have lost a total of 66 pound and have had a1c&#39;s from 8.8 to 6.4
my first a1c upon diagnosis was 7.3 and 3 months ago it was 6.3
my next a1c was 5.5%
let me add that she said my a1c is 7.6 and to check my bg  and monitor it
(particularly since i have an a1c test coming up in about 1 month) &hellip; sniff, sniff  &hellip; namaste steve that does suck hope you are much better now
it is about a study that showed type 2's that underwent intensive therapy to reach an a1c below 6% were more likely to die from a heart attack or stroke
while we may not agree that an a1c of 7% or under is the target, if you've never had an a1c test or you have always been sitting 8-10% without worrying about it, that 7% is a not too frightening  goal and it might get you kick started or just talking to your doctor about things
my last a1c was 5.0
what surprised me was that the intensive control was trying to accomplish an a1c below 6%
last week, my a1c was 9.2
my last a1c was 6.0 which is pretty good
would love to see one now that i am doing better, a1c was 6.2
my a1c went from 14.1 to 5.9 in just a few months
when i was diagnosed 20 some years ago my a1c was 13.2
i lost 80 pounds in the first six months after diagnosis and my a1c had dropped tp 8.4 in that 6 months
my last a1c was 6ish
i was at 457 and a1c was 10.2 on march 3,2010
on friday, december 3, 2010 i went to the doctors to get my new a1c number and i finally got the results on monday, december 6, 2010
my old a1c number was 10.8 and now my new a1c number is 5.7
went from a1c 9.0 to dec.2010 6.0
at the time of my stroke my diabetes was pretty well controlled (a1c was 6.1) and although i had lost almost 100 pounds i was still 70 pounds from my ideal weight and i was a pack a day smoker (and had been for 40 years)
my a1c has gone from 9.4 in february to 5.8
my a1c is 6.6 so i have to work on getting that down
of corse his a1c is 6.4, which is unacceptable in my realm of existence&hellip;but even if he ate all of the grains they told him to eat he would need to start taking meds again&hellip;the advice is just bad&hellip; in my first diabetes training class the magic number for carbs was 15 grams
tml english i took the a1c after eating breakfast and got the results of 7.4
not likely - an a1c is an average of the last 3 months
my sugars have been better and i'm hoping my a1c in 3 months shows better than 6.9
and also had a good feedback after my first follow up (a1c went down from 6.4 to 5.4)
&mdash;prp hi prp   i was amazed that you said you didn't know anything yet your first follow-up a1c went down from 6.4 to 5.4&hellip;you are already doing things right
6 months ago my a1c was 6.0 and it went to 6.1 being on 1/2 actos
my last hgb a1c was 7.1 and fasting glucose was 183
an a1c of 7.1% is not terrible bad
i have written up a meal plan which works well for me and i have kept my bg levels in the 80 to 130 mg/dl range, achieved an a1c of 5,5% and lost 65lbs over the course of 5 mo
tml english ok i don't know what is good but dr was excited about my latest a1c being 5.2
i received good news today, my a1c is now 5.4, down from 3 mos ago when it was 5.6 & since diagnosed when it was originally 6.8
lisa that is a great a1c level&hellip;anything below 6 is awsome&hellip;hehe mine was 10.7, but that was my starting point&hellip;hopefully in a few months i can get down to 5 or 6&hellip;wtg   vicki wow an a1c that low & 10 lbs as well
34494-satified-with-an-a1c-of-7
tml english so on another diabetic forum a member posed this question   here was my response to it and thought it would be a good spark for a discussion here as well   when i was first diagnosed i got my a1c down to 7 and doc took me off of insulin gave me met   i was like you then thought hey if ada recommends 7 then thats ok , i still get that thought occasionally now, but with that 7 i let my diet go to the wayside which led to a creeping number when i last saw that doctor and then even worse i turned 26 had to wait for new insurance with work got a job which required me to be in town more and no more good timing like christmas or spring break to go to the doctor , which lead me to not see anyone for a about a year, finally did so end of march and with my recent lab work that showed a a1c of 13 and beginning signs of kidney complications i don't think i agree anymore   its a goal for the moment but not a long term one an a1c of 7 is good
both &hellip; however my chances for a normal a1c are infinitely greater than those of just being "normal" what is a good a1c number
i had an a1c of 5.5% but i was in no danger of a hypo episode because  i was not using any diabetes medication to manage my numbers
generally speaking the ada suggests a1c of 7% for those with t 1 and  the numbers steve posted above for t 2s
he said studies trying to find the best a1c for folks found that more people died of heart events trying to stay at 5 than those between 6 and 7
i can't remember where the study he cited was conducted but a1c's lower than 6 had a higher mortality with more serious low bg episodes
i believe you are best served by keeping your a1c at or below 6.5 in order to avoid complications
or vice versa my hba1c has been hovering in the high 6's&hellip;last one was 6.9
(been a type 1 for 38+ years;  lowest a1c i've had was 5.9 back in 2004
prior to going on an insulin pump back in 2011, my hba1c had climbed into the low-mid 7's
i do have control with my a1c running between 5.8 and 6.2 for the last 18 years and my fasting blood sugars averaging 92 and 2 hours after eating averaging 125
i tested fasting at 191 and a1c 7.4 three wks ago
now i am seeing a d educator, eating better, bs not over 140 in 3 weeks,  &amp; my a1c as of thurs was 4.9
tml english my last a1c done 12/27/13 was 11.3 i was not on any medications at that point   today i had my labs done and my a1c came back at 8.3
my a1c was 6.7 (average was 6.4 for years as a t2) in january, by june it had risen up to 12.4, after a complete change of meds(oral to insulin) and closer watch on my diet i have worked my way back down to 8.2, should be all the way back to good a1c's by next check
for the last few years, i found my a1c creeping up from the 6's into the 7's
i finally saw an endo last december who got me back on the right road to better diabetes management and i've gotten the a1c back to 6.6 and 6.7
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
now, my a1c has never been over 6.9 since i was diagnosed eight years ago
normal human glucose levels: 4.3 - 5.5 % (70 - 108 mg/dl) a1c level of 5.6 - 5.9% blood glucose has exceeded the normal upper limit of the assay range, indicating an abnormality in the expected normal human range
an a1c level of 6.0% or greater represents a high risk for diabetes mellitus
my a1cs have been 6.4 and 6.0
i went in for a high blood presure check and they wanted to check for liver damage and came back with this and looked at me and said ( you need to loose weight and your a1c is high so we can put you on this med but it will make you gain wieight but it could bring down your a1c  so want do you want to do
it started out a1c 7.6 am now down to 6.5 so if you don't like what you hear from the doc
trust me, there are a lot of members here that wish that they had 6.0 a1c and have bg's (blood glucose numbers) run between 81 to 105
i've only been diagnosed 2 years but my a1cs are now in the non diabetic range and i've lost 114 lbs
here are the guidelines for a1c readings that appear on my lab reports: 4.1%-6.4%: non-diabetic children 1.5-18 years) 4.3%-6.0% non-diabetic adults 6.2%-7.0% diabetic well-controlled 7.0%-8.0% diabetic fair controlled &gt;8.0% diabetic poor control   according to this, you should strive to get your a1c into the 6's
i'm trying to get my a1c down to below 7, which is the cut off
one wants their a1c to be below 7
when diagnosed in july 2011 my a1c was 12.3, my last a1c on february 8 was 5.6
a1c was 6.6, am waiting for appt on march 6th for new test
a1c of 7
an a1c of 7 is generally pleasing to most drs if their patient has diabetes
"normal" people's a1c usually run from anything like the high 3s to the high 5s
my latest a1c was a 5.5
of course an a1c of 7 is no reason to slack off
i know my a1c has been in the 6.5 and i was told that they would like it to be a little higher so just be thankful that all is okay and do not let it go any higher
a1c is a percentage (to be really technical, it is the percent of your red blood cells that have been glycated which means that glucose has kind of left it&#39;s mark on the cell)
a non-diabetic will have an a1c of 4 or 5%
if your a1c gets above 9% your doctor will likely be very concerned and try to prescribe aggressive treatments to get things in better control
before the severe pain started, my bs started climbing and when the pain got really severe my bs  went higher than it ever does (i usually keep a1c's below 6)
my blood sugars are usually over 200's sometimes lower and my a1c is 10.4
my endo told me i can't go on my school field trip to cedar point until i lower my a1c to at least a 9
my a1c is 9.4
my last a1c was 7.0 but i want to get it back into the 6's
on my most recent labs i have managed to get my a1c from 10.8 down to 8.6
i am faithful about taking the lantus an actos, but hardely ever test my blood sugars or us my humalog pen, but a1c test have always been anywhere from 6.4 to 6.7 why
my a1c is 6.1 and i have mostly good numbers, when they are bad it is because i did something wrong
this kit should not replace your a1c test that you receive at your doctors office, but should supplement it (you can test yourself in between test) or if you cannot afford to have your a1c tested at your doctors office, this test may be for you
since she took me off the pills and put me on all insulin my a1c went from 14 to 6.6 in 3 months
my a1c dropped from 7.8 to 5.4
my former a1c of 6.2 is now 5.9 and i've lost about 8 lbs since then
tml english my doctor has put me on metformin and  glipizide along with byetta injections to control my appetite, i am doing great, my a1c was only 6.7 from 8 something before
i guess if i would have ate healthy every day then i wouldn't have had to go on glipizide too, but i like to let loose and enjoy life once in awhile, i get carried away and i gain too much weight, oh well, maybe if i try harder this next winter, i won't, good luck on your metformin dennis1963 i take 2.5 in the morning and 2.5 at supper time my last a1c was 5.8 in fact the last 3 were the same
14807-new-a1c-3-months-after-diagnosis
tml english after being diagnosed as type 1 diabetic in december with an a1c of 14.3, i got my new blood work results today - 6.4
congratulations on that great work getting the a1c down to 6.4 so quickly
16762-what-is-the-single-biggest-obstacle-preventing-you-from-an-a1c-lt-7
for me (type 1), the matching of insulin to food is probably the hardest, closely followed by the need to minimize the risk for hypos (for the record my a1c is 7 it just takes some work to keep it there :)) would love to hear your challenges
quit taking my blood sugar readings and in 6 months my a1c was 9.9 so my doctor put me on 1000x2 metformia last week
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
my a1c is now steady around 6.5-7.0, well worth the price i've never heard of it either
i don't know what my a1c is but a month ago it was 11
happy holidays, now let's get past christmas and the rest should be easy sailing:) this week i retest my a1c so i'm sure there must be a major improvement from last reading being 11 a month ago, over the last two wks
if your a1c was last 11, its got to be peaking fairly high somewhere in there
i achieved a personal-best a1c reading of 5.3 this year
i was able to get my a1c back down to 6.7
yet,just joined the group this morning,wow your a1c is 6.7
my average a1c was 6.2% with none over 6.5% (another streak i want to continue)
my goal with d, is the same as yours, i hope to achieve an a1c of less than 5.4 which has been my best so far
y hb a1c was 6 then
i also look at 2011 as time when i went from a1c 8.7 at the time of diagnosis to 6.6 in 3 months
19617-my-blood-glucose-numbers-went-from-100-to-280-and-my-a1c-went-from-6-0-to-8-2
my last a1c was 6.9 and my weight has ranged between 118 and 123 lbs these last 15 years
8 years now &hellip; 165 pound weight loss blood pressure normal cholesterol ratios "ideal" off statins a1c 5.7 best thing i ever did i credit lchf (moderate protein)
beat my a1c down to under 5
just had my last a1c a few days ago and it was 7.0
my a1c was 9 and my blood sugar came back at 180
i was a little like you, but i went blurry, my blood sugar was 550 my a1c was 10.3   but previously i had 3 surgeries within 2  years &amp; all the pre-surgery testing never showed high blood sugar, it was always nomal
normal is 100  and a normal a1c is 4 or 5
last a1c - 9.6
if you are only on lantus, it's possible that you need mealtime insulin, especially with an a1c of 9.4
my sugars have been good, my a1c is down to 6.1 as of january
my a1c is always around 6
my a1c is 6.5 and it took hard work to get it there
my a1c goes from 6.5 down to 5.4 but once you are diabetic you are always diabetic
my a1c was 14
my a1c came back at 6.3 last month and i know i can make it even better
my a1c is down to 6.0&hellip;from 6.5 a1c five months ago
i thought it strange that my a1c reading was down (6.0) while this insulin reading was way  waaaaaay  up above normal
last a1c done in april was 12.9 and trigli was at 1436 grandpa bill an auntie are you guys consistant with taking your diabetic medication good morning young man
my a1c went from 14 down to 8.8 in the first 3 months
my first a1c was 6.4 and my last one was 6.1 so i don't have any problems with control
my a1c's were best when i was using the inhaler and then progressively worsened when i went back to shots (even with the 4 vs 2 per day)
my a1c was at a 12 before i started the pump and mow it is at a 8 so i have done very well with it and it does work for some people and not so well for others
in fact, my endocrinologist has been working with me to get my a1c back below 7&hellip;i've slipped in control over the last 12 months and need to tighten up the carb intake and balance the insulin units accordingly
my last a1c was 6.9 so i would love to be below 6 if possible&hellip; we just need to keep plugging away&hellip; i take byetta before breakfast, dinner ( 10 units) my doc just added the 5 units before lunch to see if i can not have my eating binges between lunch and dinner (bigger span of time than between breakfast and lunch)
i told them my a1c at that time was 6.1, which i thought was awesome&hellip; seems to some of those people that if it isn't in the low 5's it isn't in control
i'm still injecting&hellip;a1c is 6 and i feel great
so yeah, even with 4 a1c in a row over the last 18 months my doctor takes diabetes into consideration for anything he treats me for or instructs me on
my a1c test a couple of weeks ago was 5.2
i don't think i'll ever see an a1c of 5.2
during one of those times when she had cortisone in her her a1c was 6.0 yet her fasting bgs were consistently in the upper 200s
well, according to my endo this week at joslin: my a1c was 5.4, and he said now of course this is a non-diabetic number
this is the lowest a1c i have ever had, once i had an 5.6 when first diagnosed
i had lost 65lbs, keep my bg levels normalized and my a1c in the 5.5 range
july- glucose 86, a1c 5.7 oct- glucose 96, a1c 5.3   help
:) i am also trying to figure out how i fit in no meds a1c 6.9 sugar never above 240 no matter what  i eat your numbers are in the diabetic range
last a1c was 5.3, &amp; my bg is never above 100, except for twice in 6 months
6.9 a1c and blood sugar up to 240 is far from normal and higher than pre-diabetic
however; a non-diabetic a1c is 4.6-5.3 i believe
a1c normal a1c= 4.5% to 5.7%  pre diabetes = 5.8% to 6.4% diabetes diagnosis = 6.5% or higher
if you are overweight and have other risk factors then your dr may have thought that the a1c of 5.7% (which is at the top of normal) was a sign that you are heading towards pre diabetes and thus it was a good idea to repeat the test in october
my doctor declares me diabetic and my first a1c was 5.7, second was 5.4, been way too long since i've had another
you can have an a1c every 3 months but by the standards you have listed it does not seem that you have type 2
i am just close enough to say the heck with docs &amp; just live my life to the fullest i can&hellip; oops i forgot this pre-diabetes: fasting 100-125, 2 hours after a meal 140-199, a1c's 5.7%-6.4% , is the a1c for the 96 glucose a 5.7 if so that would flag it in the lab results as pre
oct readings&hellip;a1c 5.3&hellip;glucose 96
(after years with a1c's in the 6's, it's been creeping up into the 7's )   a medtronics' rep is supposed to be contacting me soon but the doctor didn't push any one meter over the other
prior to pump therapy, my a1c was always over 12
since learning how to use the pump, count carbs, my a1c has consistently been near 6.3, the biggest negative is being hooked up 24/7
tml english hey friends-i went to the doctor on monday and she tested my a1c it wad 6.4
thanks everyone ;) a1c  &lt;7 is usually considered the goal because that was achieved in the dcct (diabetes control and complications trial)
the goal of the study was intensive bg management as close as possible to an a1c of 6 to study the effect on long-term complications of diabetes
study participants were able to get below an a1c of 7 and saw dramatic reductions in risk of complications
my a1c was 6.4 when i was dx
at one time an a1c of 5.8 was considered the high end of normal for someone without diabetes&hellip;i'm not sure that still holds
in either case, during the twenty years that i've had diabetes, every diabetes specialist that i have ever met felt that an a1c between 6.0 and 6,5 was quite good
thank you :) i recently  saw a neurologist for my neuropathy and he strongly recommended an a1c of less than 6.0 to prevent the neuropathy from progressing and avoiding further complications
i am on insulin and i have lost 10 pounds in 3 months and my a1c is 5.6
my a1c is 5.8 and a year ago i was walking 2 miles a day &hellip; a month ago about a mile a day &hellip; now it is a struggle to get to the bathroom
he said my a1c was an 8 and my triglycerides were very high&mdash;-150 at that time
as a type ii diabetic the highest my blood sugar was 250, that's when i was diagnost but with oral meds once a day and loosing 53 lbs, along with daily exercise, my blood sugar is averaging 94, and a1c is at 5.7
first time in life part of physicals revealed my a1c at 8.5
my doc's thinking of upping my dose of met soon, but she wants another a1c first, i'm 5'8" and i was never more than 150lbs, but ever since we've started the insulin, i've gon up almost 10lbs a year
tml english back in 09 i was put in the hospital with a tia i never know what that was but i learned fast cause test were coming back and i found out i had diabetes and cholestrol problems well i was doing good for a while and i let go stoped taking the meds or i was just taking them when ever i felt like it well here in july i ended up in the hospital agian and this time i really did mess up cause my a1c level was12.3 my sugars were runing from 450 to about 523 well i ended up on insulin and taking my metformin  i was doing alright and i mess up again and was just takung meds when ever well i just ended back into the hospital with my sugars 565 i just dont know what to do anymore it stress me out cause i dont have energy to excresize i cant sleep and my body feels tired all the time i cant lose wieght i always stay between 290 and 300 sometimes more and i just dont know what to do im looking for suport and friends that have the same i do will help a lot i know how you feel about the emotional roller coaster
and it helps more now when my last a1c is 5.2 and my doctor said he may change my meds or lower my meds
i have kept all my a1c numbers  around 5.7,5.4,5.4,5.5,5.4,5.2
i have been dealing with this for 8 years and my a1c has varied between 6.1 and 5.8 for the past 7 years so unless i get a real shock this time i will be getting off the metformin
i have a fairly strict diet, exercise every day and my thought is that if i can keep my a1c at or below 6.5 i'd be happy as getting off meds has always been my goal
now this&hellip; i have been off all diabetic medications since my bariatric surgery but found that my bs daily was sliding up even though i am still losing weight,  so after my last labs where my a1c was 7.4, i elected to go back on metformin
an a1c of 6.5 is my target
your a1c may take 3,6 even 9 months before you have it under control
since diagnosed i went from a1c 7.4 to 6.1 in nine months
my goal for 2015 is to maintain my weight loss and get my a1c down to 5.7 or lower
the last a1c i had from my doctor was 6.2, a little up from the one before, which was 6.0
mine is every 3 months but i am on insulin type 2 hello  you can get a a1c test at the drug store thats quick but my doc dose one every 6 months or so but i am under good controil hope this helps h my dr
a1c level%    avg glucose(mg/dl) 4.0           60 4.5-5.0       90    non diabetic 5.5-6.0       120      levels   6.50-7.0      150     slightly  7.50-8.0      180     elevated                        levels   8.5-9.0       210      elevated  9.5-10.0      240       levels   10.50-11.0    270 11.50-12.0    300      seriously 12.50-13.0    330      elevated  13.50-14.0    360       levels so a couple of important points when you discuss a scale like this
so your 30-day average on your meter might be 120 and yet your a1c might be 8 or more
i knew that the a1c is a 3 mo average of your bs counts but i did not know where the bs counts stood
my a1c has been as high as 11 but my last a1c was 7.7 which means my counts were averaging around 180
lynda,   thanks for posting this&hellip;i just found out today that my a1c level is 10.7&hellip;woo that was news to me
my a1c was 11.1 at dx last october but down to 6.5 in may
congrats on getting your a1c down to 6.5
this is how i went from a1c 14.1 to 5.9 in just about 4 months
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
his a1c has been 10+ for a while
my a1c was at 6 and had increased from 5.6 at my last visit
latest a1c was 7.0, but my blood sugar levels have been really high the past two weeks
first of all your higher a1c levels and the blood glucose (bg) levels which causes the higher a1c percentages may well be attributed to higher carb loads on your metabolism
i was diagnosed on april 1, 2013 with diabetes and had an a1c of 12.9 as of october 1, i've managed to bring that down to 7.9
alan tomismom   last year i was diagnosed with an a1c of 14.1 and fasting blood sugar of 366
4 months later my a1c was 5.9 and my last 4 tests have all been under 6.0   i wrote how i control my blood sugar here
i know about the high numbers too, on the day of my physical my fasting numbers were 382 and my a1c was 13.2 most mornings now my fasting numbers are around 85 and i can't wait to get a new a1c test done in a couple months to see where it is now
don't much care about naysayers&hellip;i mean seriously&hellip;what has conventional wisdom done for diabetics in this country&hellip;we have people shit giggley happy because their a1c is 6.5
tml english okay, for the good:   a1c was 7.1  (down from 9.7 3 months ago) fasting 108 (it was over 200) overall cholestrol:  196 (first time it has ever been under 200 that i am aware of - even in my 20s) ldl:  125  (she still wants it lower but it is my lowest to date) hdl:  57 (down a little but still good) trig:  69   the not so exciting:   my weight has not change in 3 months even though i have changed my diet
my last a1c was 8.4 so i need some serious lowering
for my a1c, she wants it below 7, so i am almost at her goal for me on that
in late august i ended up in the hospital with a bad infection, bg at 377, and an a1c of 14
in october i had gotten my a1c down to 7.1
i manage my blood glucose (bg) levels and keep them close to the "normal" range most of the time, and i have lost 65 lbs in the past year and my last a1c was 5.5
and had an a1c over 10
my may a1c was 5.5 and my weight has dropped about 50 lbs, without a lot of stress or a lot of exercise
not bad, considering that my a1c's were hovering around 8
my last a1c was 10.5 i just woke up and i'm thirsty as can be water doesn't help my mouth is really dry i'm taking metformin your a1c reveals that your bg's are higher than they should be averaging around 255
i tried this for over a year &hellip; saw no improvement in daily readings and a1c stayed at 5,8 ymmv, but my experience with "natural cures" has been disappointing &hellip; so much so i stopped trying them
tml english my a1c is 14.3
i managed to go from an a1c of 11.2 down to 7.2 in about 4 months
my last a1c was 8.7, not whaere the dr wants, but damn good for me
i have been a type 1 for 14yrs and am on the pump again, my doctors have always been workin with me on my a1c and meals (because i am carb sensitive), but this new doc says i should only eat 3 meals a day and my high activity at work will not affect my bs with a good carb breakfast, well my first problem is i don't eat brakfast, never have, never will, it's just not a meal i am hungry for, may not be the best answer, but the only one i got
my a1c went from 14.1 to 5.9 in 4 months
my last a1c was 6.8
i have had some neuropathy for many years but then my diabetes control improved after learning to count carbs and my a1c's dropped below 6.0
i went for my first a1c since being diagnoised(sp) w/t2
in 3 months i lost 31.5# and went from an a1c of 8.1 to 6.6 (which my dr said is still too high)
a1c of 5.5, and i lost 65 lbs this past year
my a1c is 5.6 all i need now is the willpower
golas are to get my a1c level below 7 and keep it there
the a1c test shows that she could be getting closer to t1 as the oral medications aren't giving her as good of control as they would like
she lost over 11 lbs in 6wks which we thought was great because she had been working hard, however they also said the weight loss could be another factor for her getting closer to t1&hellip; because the a1c was higher it prompted other tests to be ran, without the a1c they would not have known there was a change other than some higher bgl's she'd been having with no explanation of why they were higher
to my understanding the a1c is supose to be below 7.0 for diabetics
the a1c is very important and really needs to be done every 3 mos
i personally have my a1c done on a 3 month basis
i will let other friends on this site tell you how they do it&hellip; &hellip;debe i have used the at home a1c and it is fairly accurate and $9.00 including the lab and postage here in wi at walmart
i was able to keep my fasting bg in the 80 to 130 mg/dl range, achieve an a1c of 5.5%, and lost 65 lbs over the course of 5 mo
found out my a1c was &lt; 14
you can't do anything about the past and the a1c of 14
tml english got my results from my a1c and with all the different medications i take i got a 6.5 can we say woohoo
a1c 5.4 -2 week average 112
saw my doctor and i went from 7.0 a1c to 7.8 and there was some evidence of (bear with me here)&hellip;sugars spilling from my kidneys or into my kidneys&hellip;
my a1c was 14.7 in april, 9.4 in june and i have a a1c scheduled late this month that i expect to be a 6 or 7 as my blood sugar average is 102
7370-a1c-from-6-4-to-5-4-in-3-months-yeah
my a1c has gone down from 6.4 to 5.4 (stops typing and does goes off to do a  "happy dance" and comes back to typing)
here are the stats:   before 4/19/2010    a1c : 6.4    fasting glucose average : 140   total cholesterol : 198     hdl : 35     ldl : 136     triglycerides : 134      after 7/13/2010   a1c : 5.4    fasting glucose average : 110   total cholesterol : 165     hdl : 38     ldl : 108     triglycerides : 94   i still have a long journey ahead to reach my goal
wish i could have done that with out medication i went from an a1c of 14.6 in january to 10.2 march and now 6.5 in july but i could not do it with out my insulin pump
well when i did the a1c it came back at 6.0
my last a1c was 5.5&hellip;perfect
congrats on the a1c, 5.5 is very normal, to me at least
my current a1c is 7.8
my a1c right now is a 7 but my dr would like it at a 5&hellip; what were some of your a1c when you got pregnant
a1c down to 5.5 from 6.4
hen i started exercising and losing weight, my a1c was better 3 months later, all my cholesterol levels were much improved
it did help me alot my a1c was 10.3 &amp; now it's 5.5   best wishes diane the emotional turmoil that you are going through contribute greatly to your high numbers
readings are normal and my a1c is in the low 5's
my a1c went from 12.8 down to 6.7 in that 6 months
my bp came way down (90/50 now), my a1c went from 10.7 to 7.4
bg 240/ a1c 11.7
you really need to work on getting your a1c lower than 7,5 it can be an attainable goal
i had an a1c done which will give you a 3 month reading and told yes, i am diabetic type 2 and put on an oral med
in 3 months my a1c was down to 7.1 which shocked my doc who had already written a higher dose of meds for me because he assumed i would be needing them
o my main question is can pain or vicodan keep your bloodsugar high i was running 95 to 100 bs an a a1c as a 6 now it's a 9 to 10 an my morning bs is in the upper 210 to 230 chronic pain will make your sugar higher
i am sad to say mine last a1c was 8.8 4-15-13
i think we diabetics should also aim for an a1c reading of 4% - 6%
an a1c reading of 4% is good for a non-diabetic and may be achievable for type 2's who have great control of their blood sugars
at one time 5.8% was the high acceptable a1c for a non-diabetic with 5.9% to 7.0% indicative of an a1c for a diabetic with good control&hellip;but that may have been revised
for example, an avg 8.3 mmol which is the same as an average 150 mg/dl would yield an a1c of 7
a checkup of a1c every 3 months is highly recommended
hi all my a1c is at 6.1 atm i've have type 1 since i was 13 and i'm now 29
it was 5.9  &amp; i need to have it recheck in july when i go back to the doctor last a1c in april was 6.0
my last a1c was 6.7 and was in may
hummm  went to my dr yesterday and she would not increase the metformin, i take 1000mg a day but said if my a1c was over 6.5 she would
read one article where one guy was angry because his a1c count was 5.9, what i would give to have an a1c like that
do you know what your a1c is (that's a lab test that the doc does to see what your average reading has been over the last 3 months)
i lost 75 pounds and my a1c is at 5.9 &hellip; so working for me
i feel better&hellip;lost weight&hellip;a1c is back to 6.5 instead of 7.3 i have to say both, yes and no
you can have great a1c numbers and still have problems in other areas great infomation, i had heart surgury my sugar was fasting was 95 but my a1c was 5.7 that is why i would like to test it evety now and then
i have been using the bayer a1c home test kit for about 3 years now
ask for the a1c, so i find out what it is when i have tests done every 3 to 4 months
a1c tells you how you've done over the last few months but the daily readings show if there is an issue before you have the a1c
my a1c went from 14.1 to 5.9 in about 4 months
my a1c went from 14.1 to 5.9 in about 4 months
annette boofy   feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
my a1c has never been below 7.0 since i was first diagnosed with diabetes
i have kept my fasting bg levels in the normal range and achieved an a1c of 5.5%
make sure to keep your a1c in the 6 range
my a1c is 7.4 and lowering
i was diagnosed in may with a 10.5 a1c, in september it was down to around 7.4 i think
ood luck feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
tml english hi&hellip;i recently diagonised with diabetes on 4th of april 2014 and my glu levels are 7.08 (ref 3.50 - 5.50 mmol/l),chol levels are 7.03 (ref 3.11 - 5.96 mmol/l,ldl 4.76 (ref 0.00 - 3.37 mmol/l) hba1c is 6.8 (ref 4.0 - 6.0 %) and eag 8.3 (ref 3.8 - 7.8 mmol/l)
a normal, non-diabetic a1c is around 4.5-5.4
a1c in the 5's for last 3 years i was using byetta twice a day for a while before my pregnancy in 2011
my a1c did not change that drastically, but i was only on it like 6 months
a1c has been in the 5's last 2 years
before i had my a1c done (7.4) i had a couple of free screenings at a little clinic sponsored by publix grocery stores
that would be most appreciated james my a1c is 7.8
i have been struggling terribly, just terribly , to get my a1c up, but, it was found when i was in the emergency room about a year ago that my red blood cells turn over at a much much higher rate than normal, meaning, i have rarely been able to get an accurate a1c, so what i'm doing is focusing on trying to raise it
yeah, i know it seems backwards, but it's not&mdash;i feel bad at an a1c of 5.9, and no, i am nowhere near being pre-diabetic
it continues to frustrate me beyond belief that i can't really talk about my a1c with most other diabetics, as my blood does not do a good job at all really of showing an accurate a1c
and they told me that my a1c is down to 8.1
and my blood glucose numbers are better now then they were even a month ago and i am fully expecting my next a1c to be even lower than my last which was 5.4&hellip;sooooooooooo&hellip;ooo and i eat two  omega 3 eggs fried in butter everyday
my a1c is 5.4&hellip;don't listen to the dead guy
for years, i was able to eat 120 total carb grams per day and keep my hba1c in the 6's
lately, my hba1c has crept to 7.0, even though i've increased my exercise, so, i'm now limiting myself to 115 grams per day and will reduce it further if i still need to improve
my last a1c was 6.9
my highest ever hba1c was in the low/mid 7's
my last a1c was 6.9 and has been in the mid to high 6's for the past several years
i know it has worked well for me:  bg levels in the normal range, a1c was 5.5, and i had lost 65 lbs since feb 2011
little puzzled because my first a1c went diagnosed in july was 5.8
my a1c was at 5.3 after about 3 months on this diet
my blood sugars ave between 350 to 400 daily im on inslun my a1c is 11 any suggustions to help me lower it i also have very bad neuropathy where i can hardly walk im only 54 &amp; alone i just dont know whatto do welcome to diabetic connect
my last 2 a1cs were both 6.5 with only 500 of metformin in the am
bydureon is not prescribed for weight loss specifically&hellip;but i do anticipate that my a1c shall drop below 5 on this med
just wondering about weight loss&hellip;   denise i doubt bydureon will drop your a1c below 5, but the combination of metformin and glp-1 agonist like bydureon will result in some weight loss and some lowering of a1c   ultimately, however, life style intervention programs are twice as effective at medications in reaching treatment goals
my a1c was 12.8
my latest a1c has dropped down to 12.5
my a1c was 13.2&hellip; which we all know is horrible
last week and i'm happy to report that my a1c is now 5.8 and i'm 35 lbs lighter
i've kept my a1c below 6 since diagnosed at 9.3&hellip;  i'm praying for more good news this afternoon
a1c was 5.2
my a1c was 10.7 i have sine lost 32 pounds can't wait for my next a1c next week
my a1c is 5.1 never been over 5.8 in 6 years so i must be doing something right
over 7 a1c points down and 35 lbs gone in less than 4 months
a1c was 13.5 at diagnosis &amp; is now at 10
managing your "abc's" (a1c, blood pressure, cholesterol) is common for a lot of type 2 diabetics &hellip; certainly is for me
doing that i have managed to get the a1c to 5.8 (still taking metformin 500 mg 2x daily), go from 20 mg lisinopril to 5 mg (hope to be off them soon) and maintain normal blood pressure, get off pravachol and maintain excellent cholesterol numbers
figured the a1c would be high, but was shocked to see it was 9.2
my blood sugar was 125, my a1c was 6.2, my triglycerides went down 300 points (thank god) that runs in my family and the fish oil definitely seems to be helping
my dr put me on metformin because a1c was 6.5 and now i am tired beyond belief
your doctor put you on metformin because you had an a1c of 6.5
she said my a1c of 7.4 was ok even tho up from 6.5
a1c readings are a measure of the 30 day half life of your bg level
the issue with using the a1c to judge your bg health only is that there are many things it doesn&#39;t tell you
then if you are a regular donor of blood, this too can lower your a1c, but doesn&#39;t reflect how your control is doing
a1c is 5.7
i'm working with my doctor around changing my settings to get better control, but&hellip; my a1c went from consistent 6-6.5 using pens to being 7.5 for my last two since getting a pump
my last a1c in august was 6.6
tml english i finally got a real good doctor, got my levels where they need to be and a great a1c (6.0), and felt halfway normal again, i got hurt at work
his a1c was 5 and his other numbers were great
see, i was diagnosed with t2d in 2005 and ever since my a1c has been in the 6.3 range - well controlled for years
an a1c of 13 means that you will have complications soon, amputations, blindness, heart attack, that type of thing
you say that you have cut out all carb and are 125lbs and still have an a1c of 13 then you will have to take something
the great thing about hemoglobin a1c testing is that it averages your blood sugar levels for the past 2 - 3 months, giving you a more complete view of your overall health
thanks&hellip; my a1c will never be below a 5,(now my a1c is @ an 11.8) but my bg#s go from being as low as a 10 (taken to hospital via ambulance) to as high as a 599
my bs goes from as low as 21 to 300 and above but my a1c is 5.8 or ave
i remember i had two sets of blood work done exactly one week apart from one another, my a1c numbers from the first week was 7.3 and the second week was a 7.6
the chart is just great to have as a guideline as to what your a1c can possibly be if your blood glucose is kept within a certain parameter, it should never be used to replace an actual hba1c test administered by your physician
~mays~ it's accurate when you move from a1c to bgs because a1c is an average that takes into consideration all of the specific readings, high and low
that would make it appear that your a1c reading bounces around all over in the course of a day and it doesn't because it's based in 3 months of cellular damage as read in the blood cells
my a1c levels averaged about a 12
again my starting a1c was a 12 but after being on the avandamet for a 3 month period my a1c level dropped down to 7.5
and mya1c level at my last checkup was a 6 i haven't had any side affects to speak of
i began experiencing severe hypos in 2009 with my a1c's creeping up into the 7's; my pcp kept increasing my lantus dosage and advised me to decrease my mealtime novolog bolus dosage
my last a1c was 5.4 which didn't make any sense to me either since my sugars stay so high, but then again that was taken right after my daughter was born when i was still on insulin
my a1c was great&hellip; 6.8
you should be having an a1c every 3 mos
wow, i agree your a1c of 5.4 is great, however, 300 to 500 bs readings are not
my one and only a1c was 13.7 and now i take 3 insulin shots per day
when i first diagnosed with diabetes my a1c was 16.9
actually the a1c is like a snapshot of the average  of your bg levels over the last 90 days
a1c is a measure of glucose that are attached to your red blood cells for the last 3 months to see how well you have managed your blood sugar
if yours only live 60 days then your a1c will be a lot lower than somebody who's live 120 days if all other factors are the same
he did blood work and my a1c was 9
that has allowed me to maintain my weight at 120  pounds and my last a1c was 6.8 which is considered good for a person with diabetes
tml english so  i got my a1c test results 7.9   3months ago or so it was 7.6  my doc says take one 500 metformim at night if it is 160 or higher
sooo&hellip;all i can say is our individual bg test only give us information about a short window of time&hellip;where as the a1cs give us the "big picture"&hellip;it is like a snap shot of everything that has been happening to our bg for a period of 3 mos (some say 4)&hellip;i would go by your a1c and work on a way to bring down your glucose levels&hellip;adding more exercise might help&hellip;or cutting down on carbs&hellip;or both&hellip;sorry i cant be more help
doc told me just take 500 in morn only take 500 at night    if it was 160 or higher   since then a1c  has been going up   this has been about 8 month journey jerry  an a 1c of 7 isn't all that bad
i have had an a1c of 7 for10 years or more
maybe the a1c of 7 is a little high for you, but it is not so high as to do you harm in the short term
going back to those drugs are worse than an  a1c of 7 for now
doc told me just take 500 in morn only take 500 at night    if it was 160 or higher   since then a1c  has been going up   this has been about 8 month journey diabetes is a crazy disease, there are no definitive norms to it
before my last a1c i tested and it said 80
thanks my dr wasn't happy with my a1c initial it was 11.9 but i'm doing better just still trying to get things adjusted but thanks for the advice
i also follow a high protein, low carb meal plan for 3+ yrs now and i had initially  lost  65 lbs,over 5 mo stopped taking my twice daily injection of nph insulin, kept my bg (blood glucose) levels in the vicinity of 80 to 130 mg/dl and achhieved an a1c of 5.5%  i have written up that meal plan and i offer it to anyone who asks
tml english im doing great on james diet that he sujested for me to try,an i've lost ten pounds,got a good rating from my doctor an he took me off my insuline all together,an my a1c was 5.5 an thats great,but he said he would like it at no higher then 120 an no lower then 95,now in the morning it runs between 140 to 199 at other times its where he wants it,i have to say thanks to jaybee an everone on dc for making this posabile,thanks a million everyone
yes done the denial thing, still do sometimes, i'm bad about testing, my last a1c was 14 and i have got to get on track
tml english the a1c accounts for less than 25% of the variation in risks of diabetes complications
i have managed to stay off medicine, lowered my cholesterol back to a normal range, and my last a1c was 5.1%
he other thing that thrilled me was my a1c was 5.6 which continues to improve
on the pump my highest a1c was 14
you want you a1c to below a cetain number by 2 months or 3 months from now   one main goal would be to pause and give yourself a higher priority tell those around you your goals and times to check and ask for their help to remember
but after some scary sugar numbers an a1c of 11 and having all the problems i started caring
i am now limiting myself to 115 grams and, if that doesn't get my a1c back into the 6's, i'll have to cut back even more
tml english i was just at me endo and my a1c was up to 6.5 from ^.2 in april, he seemed ok with it but i wasn't
my a1c had crept up into the 7's
my a1c was 14 &mdash; so i qualified for oral surgery to remove what is left of my teeth
right now i haven't had any eye problems and to keep it that way is to have a1c under 7
my last a1c was 7.4, down from a former 10.3
thankfully, my eyes are fine and my a1c is 5.7, so i'm not anticipating problems
glad you are doing well also i just had my a1c checked and it was 6.6 i thought i was doing well, but not sure now
my a1c is currently 6.1
since being diagnosed as a diabetic, i have not been able to get my a1c below 6.0
merry christmas &amp; hope we can get our a1c lower in 2012
thank you if you don't find much fluxuation in your day-to-day bg readings during those 6 mos then you wouldn't find your a1c changing all that much even if you took your a1c within the 3 month period as one normally would
so outside of the expense of doing the a1c every 3 months, that would probably be the only difference

i have always kept my a1c well under that magic number 7
this surprises me as my a1c has been over 13 for the past three years
an a1c over 13 is extremely high
diagnosed: april 2009 a1c: the last time i went to the doctor back in october 2012, my a1c was 5.4
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
i function very well on 120 grams of carb per day and my last a1c was 6.8&hellip;still room to improve there
my last a1c was 4.9 and i weigh 162 pounds
my last a1c was 6.9, so, if i reduced my carbs, i could probably get a better a1c
i found i have to keep it under 45 per meal for my a1c to be 6% though
my bg numbers stay below 140 and my a1c is 6,1
i'm not sure what you mean by that (being re-diagnosed) as my bg levels and a1c's and bloodwork have been very good for going on 3 years since he and i started working on things together
btw a1c was a 5.7 from 5.9 3 months earlier so good visit
my a1c was 11.8 when i took my bs it was almost always in the 300's some times low 400's
i feel better and my a1c went from 8.9 to 7
my a1c went from 12 to a 6.7
in less than a year i got my a1c down to a 5
by following my own method, i got my a1c down from 6.8 to 5.3 without any meds at all, and with spikes into the 200+ range too
iron that's funny i take check my bg before eating and two hours after eating and this determines what kind of meals i should eat also i'm hoping to bring my a1c down from 6:2 to 5 "eating to your meter" is a really good way to discover how different foods and also exercise, stress, lack of sleep, etc affect your blood sugar levels
i have been trying to practice tight control&hellip; i currently have an a1c of 5.4
i am on a quest for an a1c in the mid to lower 5's and to that end i have been keeping my fasting bgl at 90 (+/-) and 1 hour post meal 140 or less
my a1c went from 14.1 to 5.4 in less than a year
and keeping my a1c down (was 12 but a month and a half in the program it is now 8.7)
i went on dialysis and continued my life   my a1c had never been below 6.1 (to my knowledge) even after the nph
when i avoided grain products, and i ate very carefully, my a1c eventually became 5.5, my bg readings became normaized and i lost about 65 lbs (over about 5 mos)
and my a1c is now 5.4 , dow from 14
every evening, when i go to get up out of my chair, i have to lean up against a wall, and my left foot ( which was ulcerated since july, then "healed") is back to being ulcerated and worse&hellip;my a1c was only 5.9 the last time, and i walk and run 5 days a week, however, when my a1c was only 5.9, my highs were ( still are) between 200 and 600, and my lows in the 50s
i guess the sooner i get back in to a doctor, the better&mdash;-my triglycerides were almost 500 along with an a1c of 5.9 about 4 months ago
i've had insulin, but now my blood sugars are so unstable, along with a low a1c, that insulin is out of the question&mdash;-i am allergic to metformin, and my pancreas also rejected it when i was on that 5 years ago
i'm amazed to hear your a1c is only 0.2 above mine, yet you have readings of 600
he said that neither type 1 nor type 1 would have a range like that&hellip;way too out of range for a type 2, but never would a type 1 have an a1c of 5.9, unless something extreme was going on
tml english i have committed to getting my a1c down to 6.5 from 7.9
tml english just had a good 3 month visit with endo and a1c was 3 point lower than 3 months before the only trouble area was the blood pressure
a1c was over 10 by the time they figured out i'm t1
my a1c stays around 5.9 to 6.1
but my last a1c was at 7.2
9-10 a1c is bad but blood sugar in mmol/l is not super awesome but not massively bad and is actually pretty great for a newly diagnosed type 1
an a1c of 9-10 is pretty high
my problems are more nerve problems, such as spinal stenosis and pinched nerve in hip (not sure if diabetes complication or not as my a1c is 6.2) anyway, the best medicine is prevention
also i've tried and control my blood sugar as best i can with an a1c of around 6.0
an a1c of 6.0 is great but only reflects the average of your bg
an a1c of 6.0 is extremely good
it took me just over 2months to get my a1c from 8.7 to 7.1
my bs levels was t290 and my a1c was 11.2
after the first month my bs levels were down below 110 and my a1c was at a 9.1, after the 2nd month my fasting bs was around 100 and my a1c was 6.0
two months ago when i went for my routine check up this year, my a1c was 6.1
tml english last a1c was 7.5(never that high) new one 6.1 year end panel was very good
this will result in your a1c in the 6's which is perfectly fine
my a1c is down to 6.6 so i'm getting there but still not quite there yet
my lastest a1c is 5.0&hellip;nice&hellip;but a little let down&hellip;my at home test was 4.9&hellip;i know it is statistically exactly the same&hellip;but
since my goal is to have normal a1cs in the 4's&hellip;it was a little disappointing&hellip;all of my other health markers are perfect
please do not further decreases the hba1c below 5 because  4.1 =68 mg/dl 5.0 = 97 mg/dl 5.1 mg /dl  = 100    5.8= 120 mg /dl   remember these things for diabetic persons it may be the chances fully hypo then it is too much dangerous persons may high   chances of going to coma
my last a1c was 5.8
i don't have a clue how i am running now&hellip;stopped testing after my blood was drawn for my last a1c&hellip;i wanted to have a solid marker to measure by&hellip;changed my diet up a bit&hellip;more carbs&hellip;i had cherries yesterday (grin)&hellip;i missed cherries&hellip; girl a 5.0 is very respectable and give yourself some time
normal a1c for a non diabetic is 4.5 to 6
i am on citalopram, since 1st week in october and my 12/31 a1c was 6.0, so i am ok on it
the a1c doesn't measure blood glucose, it hemoglobin that are bonded with glucose and using the result relies on them having a uniform lifecycle of around 90-120 days
giving blood close to an a1c will reduce it, sometimes by 1 or 2%, anemia will reduce it, heavy bleeding will reduce it, low iron levels will increase it and so will having a blood transfusion because the preservative they use contains a lot of glucose that bonds with the red blood cells
medical texts that deal with the a1c say that you should not base any diagnostic or treatment decisions off an a1c when the patient has an iron deficiency
tml english so i have my a1c test at the end of this week and i checked my meter as it says my average bg for this month is 230, so my a 1c would be 9.65(looked it up)
a1c in theory returns an average blood glucose percentage over a 30 day period weighted slightly towards the last 3 weeks or so prior to the test
silly i know, but it helps me to stay on the straight and narrow at times when i am tempted go revert to my old lifestyle   steve when u mean cramming is keep bs at what level to get 6 or 5 i have question on a1c i had blood sugar in april may june between 120 to 175 but in june july aug it was 156  to 190 fasting all day in 200
when went for my a1c two week ago my a1c went to 7.9 did my blood sugar in april through june helped my number
yet one of those times her a1c was somewhere in the 6s
there will be other a1c tests later on and you can affect those a1c by keeping your bg (blood glusose) under better control
praying for better future a1c for you   james i agree with what type1lou stated
while strict control the week before you blood test might make your a1c a bit lower, the a1c will reflect the average of your control over the past several months
rather than controlling your bg levels to "pass" this a1c, concentrate your efforts on gaining better consistently overall control so that the following a1c will show better results
[09/25/2009 - information for healthcare professionals - fda] thanks for the information,  but i have to say that i have been on janumet for almost a year and have experienced great results&hellip;my a1c went from 10 to 6 and has stayed there with modest diet modifacations on my part
i was put on insulin 6 mths after i was diagnosed and was reluctant at first but it gives me greast control of my diabetes started with an a1c of 12.2 went to a 7.6 on metformin after insulin went to a 5.9
just got my a1c back at 5.9
good news since my last a1c was 6.2 i righted the ship this time a1c was 5.5  i just think that summer has helped a lot by playing softball and more exercise and eating low carbs and a little more protein in my meals sure did not hurt either
thanks nick my last a1c was 6.1 would love to get below a 6 my next a1c is due in a month
were you able to keep your a1c under 7
a1c, around the 7 mark
my a1c i belive is 9.3 or something like that
the a1c is 7.7 and i keep trying to bring it down
i got another meter, the same brand and it seemed somewhat better but when i had my a1c done and expected a good result due to the numbers i had been taking (6 times per day), i thought i should be at about 5.6
so, it came to a shock to me when my a1c came out at 6.2
with the meter i am using my fasting blood sugar has averaged 91 for the last 6 months and my a1c is at 5.9 so i'm assuming things are okay
an a1c of 5.9 is good and your average sounds like you are under good control
yet my a1c is 5.8 and my physician said i'm not diabetic anymore - even with a hospital reading of 170
my mom has a pacemaker (recent) and i have heart disease and had a stent put in 2 years ago (i'm only 47)  my  parents were diagnosed years ago while i was "assumed" to be type 2 because of my heart disease (my a1c is less than 7.0)
tml english have been thinking about getting my a1c results this tuesday for most of the day&hellip;doc wants to take me off if i come in at 5.7 or lower&hellip;i am currently taking the lowest dose of metformin once a day (500mg)&hellip;but the more i think about it the more i realize that one can not go by just one a1c result&hellip;i realize my last a1c was 5.9&hellip;and i am expecting this one to go down significantly because my bg numbers have come down significantly&hellip;but all of these measurements/test come with a certain amount if "wiggle room"&hellip;and a1cs can be off by as much as .5&hellip;so i have decided that if i can duplicate an a1c lower than 5.7 on my next a1c (not the one i just took)&hellip;i will go off meds&hellip;i am in no hurry and i like to consider all things before making decisions
sometimes i believe i think too much&hellip;but i think that 2 consecutive a1cs under 5.7&hellip;would relieve a lot of the stress i am feeling at the thought of coming off my meds right now&hellip;my son keeps hearing me refer to my metformin as my diabetes "crutch"&hellip;so he would like to see me off of it asap&hellip;i reminded him that i am losing at least 10 pounds a month and three months from now at 30 pounds lighter&hellip;my insulin resistance should be better and it might help me maintain my a1c without meds better&hellip;so am i over thinking this or does it make as much sense to you as it does to me&hellip; good job
my last a1c was great and i had only been on medication for 4 months
i will need to have at least two but preferably three a1c below 6.0 before i will be convinced that i can stop the metformin
according to my doctor, i don't need to lose anymore weight but my a1c is still above 6.0
as gabby stated in another post, getting your a1c below 6 is harder than reducing a higher a1c just like losing those last 10 lbs is harder than the first 10 (or 50, or 100, lol)
i have a meal plan where i lost 65 lbs in 5 months, achieved an a1c of 5.5, maintained bg (blood glucose) levels in the "normal" (80 to 130 mg/dl) range, all while discontinuing my diabetes medications
i have managed to control my t 2 diabetes by what i eat and avoid eating and had been able to keep my bg levels around 80 to 130 mg/dl, achieve an a1c of 5.5% and lose 65 lbs over 5 mo
a1c is 5.5
tml english just got call from doc about lab results, a1c was 12.3, up from 9.6
my a1c went from 5.5% to 5.9% since i didn't have a regular supply of vitamins, i ran out for lack of money
my a1c was in the 14 range and my other tests were not so peachy either
went got a1c and it was 6.0that was in jan
five month ago had bad time went vac and got worse i thought my a1c would be 9 or 10 it was 7.9 was i thankful u can do it depression is hard to deal with also i deal with severe mental problem do u have good friend who can help u
last friday my a1c was 7.1, the best i've ever had in 24 years
but don't take my word for it, do the research for yourself-between using that and splenda my a1c is now 5.9
john i use splenda and my a1c is 6
my last a1c was 5.9
when i started to get off insulin i was at 9 on the a1c scale and now i am at 6.7 which is a major accomplishment for me
i was dx 2/2/2010 a1c 11.6 put on glipizide since with diet and excerise have lost 87 lbs and two weeks ago taken off meds
my blood levels on fast 107-115 and my a1c is at 5.4&hellip;i have type 2 it's encouraging to hear you got off the meds & kept the weight off too
my bs is good & i've gone from an a1c of 6.8 to 5.4
i don't remember what my numbers were at the time i went off my meds, it was too long ago, but the last time my a1c was at 6.1, which the dr
since the a1c is an average, it's said the accuracy is about .5% either way
it does work in 8 months i have lost 75 pounds and lowered my a1c from 12.4 to 6.2, hope to start bydureon once a week shot on october
my last a1c 1 mth ago was 5.2 down from 8.6
i have bee a diabetic for only a short a so far my bs has never gone over 200 an my a1c highest has only7.5 but i was lucky my dr
my mother's a1c had gotten down to 4.8 so they took her off of her metformin
my a1c was 6.7 and my blood glucose was 145
my normal a1c is usually 5.5 to 6.0 and my glucose stays around 125 or lower
as long as you are able to control your sugars, so have a hba1c 6.5% or less, you can push off the complications of diabetes for many years
tml english i too, have type 2 diabetes, and although my doctor feels it's under good control (a1c was 6.3), i also have stage 3 kidney disease, and have been diagnosed with bowel incontinence {weakening of the peritoneal muscle) for which i'm receiving physical therapy to try to strengthen the muscle
add to that my daughter's doctor's nurse contacted me and said i need to start monitoring her testing of her bloodc sugar (4 times a day) and her administration of her insulin  (once a day) because her last a1c (december, 2009) was 11
at this point my a1c is down to 6.1, my average sugars are 120, so my diabetes is under good control according to my diabetic/endo
what scares me is my one and only a1c test was 13.9 and it will be march 1st before i can test again
now my a1cs are consistently below 6.0
i am not real trustful of the medical community right now because a neurosurgeon wanted to do major spine surgery on me with an a1c of 12
in early january for a physical and my fasting blood sugar was 225 and a1c was 8.8
on my second visit to the dr, my a1c dropped to 7.2
i went from a1c at dx in april of 11.7 to 5.5 three months later:-)   keep up the awesome work
i'm type 2, my a1c used to be 9 now, as of this week i'm 5.4
hope we can be friends&hellip;valentine lady i'm a type 2 diabetic and my a1c is now 7.5
i went from a a1c off 11 three months ago to 6.8
i was at 11.4 a1c, after 6 months i went to a 5.7 a1c and a 96 mg/dl fasting blood sugar
you have done a super job with your a1c to 6.8
hello' congratulations, i went today 2-10-11 my a1c was 9 and my doc wants it down in 3 months
i was functionally cured of type 1 diabetes with an islet cell tranplant through the chicago diabetes project and have had normal blood sugars and a1c's for 5 years now
tml english well today i went to the dr and foud out some great news&hellip; my bp was 114/70 down from 140/89 ive lost 10lb in 6 weeks and my a1c is 6.6 down from 7.8  *\o/* today is a great day *\o/* wow
my a1c is 10.5, so i am willing to try anything to help lower my sugars
blessed be vicki omg, are you kidding me your a1c is 10.5
my last visit to my doctor my a1c was 6.8 and now it's 5.5
last a1c was 6.4
metformin did a lot to keep my blood glucose in order during a 2-year study i did with the university of minnesota comparing gastric bypass surgery with intensive medical treatment to lower a1c's in t2 diabetics
my a1c was 6 during the study (which was below their goals although i know not as low as it should have been) down from 10.5 when i started
you would not believe how many diabetics i know  who tell me they are taking metformin and their a1c is 5
checked my a1c&hellip;went from 5.6'ish to 7.2'ish
i had had my a1c levels in the mid to lower 6s
i track my numbers between 96 and 104 with an a1c of 5.8
before, i had bg readings of high and an a1c of 12.0+ and was 50 lbs over my target weight
blood glucose: fasting 70-130  postparndial bg (2 hours after) less than 180  a1c less than 7%    blood lipids:  ldl (bad cholesterol) less than 100  hdl (good cholesterol) men over 40, women over 50  triglycerides: less thank 150    blood pressure: resting under 130/80 gabby is it ok if i copy and past all this info and save it in my folder
i have my next a1c on 9/22, i can't wait to see what it is
i was having good a1c's (below 6.0) but i had a lot of highs and lows
current a1c is 6.1 and even though i would like to gain a little weight, get rid of some of the neuropathy, and arthritis pain; i realize this isn't going to happen and so continue to do what i can, when i want to and let the chips fall where they may
the past three years my a1c has been in the 5.3 to 5.7 range and blood sugar only once over 138 and never below 72, with a running 14-day average of 105 - 109 the past 3 years
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
talk to your doctor and see what they say about how you can work together to keep an a1c around 6
but i started out at 388 fasting bg and a1c of 13.2
i accidentally discovered that my pancreas was producing enough insulin on its own  when i discovered that i stopped the insulin and was able to keep my fasting bg levels in the 80 to 130 mg/dl range and achieve an a1c of 5.5%
in may my a1c was 9.3, last month it was 8.2 its coming down
because i will feel fully confident to take it when i still have just a little bit more food coming in&hellip;i now work 2 jobs, and my income has come up a pretty good amount, but, my biggest fear is taking insulin and having even just one night with little or nothing in my refrigerator&hellip;maybe that's what the guy you go to church with is worried about&hellip;my biggest fear is an insulin reaction&hellip;i am almost petrified of any low below an 80, as my body does not handle lows well at all&hellip;i can be at 400 and feel on top of the world&hellip;but, the few times i do go low, when i stupidly skip a meal, and then go for a big run&hellip;then i will fall down to 83, and it just is not good&hellip;so, just to explain it better to you : i had insulin given to me because i would have died otherwise, but, the metformin which i turned out to be allergic to, and my pancreas rejected, it set my a1c waaaay down&hellip;to the point where it gave me a light heart attack&hellip;so, that's why i still do not feel fully comfortable with insulin everyday&hellip;sooner or later i will be on it everyday&hellip;but, i am putting it off&hellip;so i can keep making sure i have enough to eat first&hellip;it is amazing what one bad experience will do to a person&hellip;since that metformin, i still have never been the same, and it's been a whole 6 years&mdash;-it almost sent me into a diabetic coma i found out&mdash;-and i took it for a whole year and a half&mdash;&mdash;so, it put my body into a state of low shock&mdash;&mdash;-i am just very very very relieved that i responded so beautifully to the insulin, as i thought the insulin would make me go down lower yet&mdash;-it did not&mdash;&mdash;it actually stabilized my blood sugars &hellip;i hope all is going well for you
me and my friend are in an a1c competition we have the same endo, and we're racing to reach 6.0 so we check in every three months to review progress and tips
feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1
tml english hi friends,   i checked my a1c yesterday and it was 8.4 and i am very upset with my readings and i am planning to get a insulin pump if it suits me
tml english i'm type 1 diabetic, went to my doctor yesterday and found out my a1c test was 13.4, which is very bad
can you give me your number i need to talk to you i have insulin for free to help out can you help me get insulin anyone i am type 1 my a1c runs about 11 to  13% and i feel horrible all the time also help with neuropathy meds they are so expensivew hi my mom also need insulin and we dont have insurance plz give any solution howdy insulinn welcome to dc
your a1c is your average from the past 3 months i thought that aic's were the 3 month tests but here in australia it is called hba's
your a1c is a 3 month average of your blood sugar represented in percentage
i think i am not trying to fool anyone since an a1c will tell all and my last a1c was so much better then the previous one
i had just taken my a1c test on friday and then out of the blue, saturday my numbers went to over 400 for the first time
13016-a1c-is-6-5
tml english i have been working for the past three on bringing down my a1c from 13
my a1c is now 6.5 and i have no diabetic nurse support&hellip;   i hope you all will help me to stay on track&hellip;i do not crave food anymore&hellip;but   i am scared to exercise because my blood sugar drop too low with it&hellip;i have to develop a better plan&hellip;help
james congradations i am working on the same my a1c was off the chart when i was first diagnosed and i am currently at 8.1 need to get a little more
my a1c in january was 10.8 very high
mine is to see my a1c in the 6 range
yet i have no diabetic symptoms, my a1c is 7.7 (not fantastic, but not terrible either) and i am getting healthier
her a1c is 10.5, she complains that she feels too weak at 90 and knows her body likes to be in the 200-300 range, can't feel her feet, and scoffs at the nutritionist who was trying to tell her she is morbidly obese and needs to practice portion control
diabetes appears to be under control(last month a1c was 6.1, down from 6.5 3 months earlier), blood pressure is on the low side of normal and cholesterol is spot on
my a1c runs around 6.7 right now, down from 18.9 in the er 6 short months ago
tml english i've been to the doctor for my six month checkup and i found that the doctor thinks my glucose and a1c levels are getting better and i've lost 4 pounds since then
i have reversed much of the damage from when i was badly out of control (a1c 20.9) when i was first talking to me medical team they said i was probably just a miracle patient
my last a1c was 5.0 without any meds
now all i use is vinegar as i take 2-3 tsp mixed with a little water before each meal and it helps keep my levels down greatly and don't take any medication and last a1c was 6.1 so very happy with results is there a particular type vinegar that you are taking
now w/my last a1c being 5.9
if you ( or anyone else ) can give me some help with that too, that would be great i was a long haul driver for 18 yrs two years ago diagnosed type 2 due to need of insulin i am no longer qualified to pass dot physical and due to there stick guidelines in the issue i no longer drive have fought to get it reinstated for six month periods to no avail doctors won't sign off on it due to legalities and liability and being against dot rules trying to find one of my dot reg books to give you section but you could probably find it online in the reg book another problem i have though is that currently i can't afford the physical, if i do get one i can't risk flunking it( this is why i need to know how to prepare ) the companies that are willing to train me will pay the physical but if i fail they will shop me right home on my dollar ( i don't want to waste anyone's time or money ) i have no way of knowing if they will use an a1c or finger prick, a1c fail, ( short notice ) finger prick i just need to be below 200 ( at the time ) i have no interest in being a risk on the road, i will be able to manage it if i'm on the oral meds , and possibly by diet alone, i ce off oral meds and chose insulin mainly because oral meds can be harder on your system, and insulting made it easier for me to cheer on my diet thanks dummy, i think i have a handle on the regs, and i believe i can manage it
i kept my blood glucose between 80 and 130 most days and i lost about 65 lbs and maintained an a1c of 5.5
with the help of metformin, i was able to keep my a1c below 6.5 the whole time, until recently
i never stuck to my diet cause it never did change my a1c when i did, when i was put on lantus it briefly went to 7.0
imagine my horror when my a1c was 10.1
i was very sick for six years, the lowest my a1c ever was was 7.0 and that was only temporary and when lantus was introduced
i never stuck to my diet cause it never did change my a1c when i did, when i was put on lantus it briefly went to 7.0
imagine my horror when my a1c was 10.1
i was very sick for six years, the lowest my a1c ever was was 7.0 and that was only temporary and when lantus was introduced
my a1c has gone down to 6.5 from 8 recently
i even lived on 600 calories the winter of 2013, and imagine the horror as he told me my a1c was 10.1
although, i suppose for a type 2 with an a1c below 6 who is doing a great job with diet and exercise, testing 5 or 6 times a day might really be overkill
my a1c this last visit was 6.1 from 6.4, but my bgs are going up and my weight is going down
so how do i do this without screwing up the progress i have made with my diabetes (recent a1c was 6.1)
my first a1c was 9 in july, and 7 3 months ago
your a1c has gone down in only 3 months, is it the meds or the way you are eating
if your a1c was 9, you are a diabetic, but sometimes underlying illnesses can imatate diabetes, like a thyroid condition or taking statin drugs
my last a1c was5.8
i'll echo that sentiment, i went off met after briefly starting it when my a1c got down to 6, but the doctor saw i was actively working on it
my last a1c was 6.5 and i am still on metformin
an a1c of 7.3 is not a good time to stop metformin
everyone i know who is off of metformin and maintain with diet and exercise was taken off when their a1c was a 5.0   you could also get a second opinion however, if you are diabetic, it is easier once you accept the fact that you have it
after i followed my new meal plan i had gotten my a1c down to 5.5 and would normally be in the 80 to 130 mg/dl range, depending on what i ate that day
keep a1c below 7&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-let me tell you, portion control at meals is important
i would also see about having one check you a1c and have them give you your diag, of type 2
my a1c level was high but below "diabetic" standards, i kept it under 6.3
now i am diabetic with an a1c of 8 and take metformin
i forgot to mention my a1c is 7 and my bg levels range in the 80-90's if your a1c is 7, that indicates that your "average" bg levels are overall higher than the 80's to 90's you're getting when you test
your a1c is a measure of your average blood glucose readings over the course of the past 2 to 3 months
according to the info i'd been given, an a1c of 7 means that you definitely have diabetes and it is not in good control
my a1c is 5.7 that is what i started out with 5.7, and my doctor told me i had full blown diabetes
my last a1c was 5.4 after losing all the weight, and exercising more, eating right most of the time
it was a rough year last year but i made it though it and as of today i got my a1c down to 8.1 and my weight is back to 187lbs
the american diabetes association suggests an a1c of 7%, which is an eag of 154 mg/dl it is my understanding that damage can/will start occuring at bgl's of over 140 (seen as low as 110 quoted also) so if damage starts at 140 why do they recommend an average bgl of 154
in my case, and for many reasons, i keep my a1c around 6.0
hi jigsaw , i "try" to keep my daily carb intake about 150 gm  with my last meal (dinner) being the majority&hellip;i am still learning about carbs but have managed to maintain an a1c of 5.4 since my diagnosis last year
an a1c of 5.4 is better then good, it's great
by the way, somehow my a1c had gotten up to 9.4, but at my last check-up it was 8.1
my last a1c was 6.8
