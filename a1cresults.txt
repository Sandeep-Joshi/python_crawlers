6.7	i have had a much easier time thus far with the a1c, my highest on record is 6.7 so i'm not too far off the recommended range	1
5.4	but my a1c was down to 5.4	1
-	although your a1c is good &hellip;165 is a concern as you didn't say what your numbers were at diagnosis i would guess that you were "pre-diabetic" and its not unusual for doctors to show little concern since you are "just" pre	1
11	steve at dx it was 365 with an a1c of 11	1
6.6	my last hba1c was 6.6	1
6.9	tml english i went to docter friday and got my test results my a1c was 6.9 i was shocked because all my sugar was really high last two weeks been good some day high but mostly great numbers	1
6.6	a1c 6.6	1
6.0	my a1c has been below 6.0 for many years	1
11	last a1c was 11, i'm hoping my next one will be less since i've had a little better control	1
6.8	i'm a 5'3" female and limit my food to 120 grams of carb per day&hellip;not easy but my last a1c was 6.8, which indicates good control	1
5.8	my a1c was 5.8	1
7.0	my last hba1c was 7.0 so there is definitely room for me to improve in my control&hellip;it may be time to get the old food diary back out	1
5.5	i don't take meds and i have had three consecutive a1c's in less than 5.5	1
6	i liked bread as much as anyone; but, i have to minimize or totally eliminate bread to maintain a steady a1c in the 6's	1
6.0	howdy cj what you said brought to mind something that happened to my late wife "jem" she had bg levels in the 300s yet on one occasion she had an a1c of 6.0	1
5.74	this week i've learned that my a1c is down to 5.74	1
5.4	when i first started taking metformin, i lost 52 pounds and a1c registered 5.4	1
5	exactly what i did&hellip;a1c=5&hellip;yes	1
7	if you're running an a1c higher than the 7's, you have a problem and you will suffer the consequences	1
7	the gorilla in the room is carb control to get to an a1c below 7	1
5.6	i went from 7.7 a1c to 5.6 in one year	1
-	speaking to her doctor he asked me if she was diabetic, i answered in the affirmative but told him that she was convinced she was cured since her last a1c to which he replied that her blood glucose level was 530 at the time of admission	1
14.1	feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1	1
5.3	i got my a1c checked and it's 5.3:)now i will always eat healthy for the rest of my life &hellip; i know a diagnosis of pre-diabetes is difficult to hear, but it's also an opportunity to change your eating and exercise habits to improve your overall health	1
5.4	a truly normal a1c will top out at around 5.4 but that isn't the goal suggested by health organizations for diabetics	1
6.7	my latest a1c was a 6.7 &mdash; a new all time low	1
6.1	my a1c is now down to 6.1	1
-	tml english a1c's were first available in 1976	1
12.46	(i remember 1988 and playing computer games on a dos system - before windows became household - lol) saw my doctor today and asked what my a1c was when he diagnosed me three weeks ago - it was 12.46	1
6.8	my last a1c was 6.8 and i'm expecting the next one in august to be lower	1
6	if you're not in control (a1c in the 6's) you're going to have a problem	1
1	this formula estimates bg readings from a1c, not a1c from bgs as this question requests	1
6.5	if your bgs are average at 140, your a1c would be about 6.5	1
1	my last two a1c test at the dr was within .1 of the results i had	1
1	here are charts but it can not really be accurate for the reasons mentioned i disagree because if the lab can formulate your a1c then there is a formula its not a formula per se&hellip;its measuring out the percentage of your glycated hemogloblin aka hemo globin a1c&hellip;this deals with the sugar our bodies have in it	1
1	he a1c is determined by measuring the percentage of glycated hemoglobin hba1c that is in your blood you can disagree all you want jshin	1
1	to find one's a1c you really need to go to a dr and have an a1c test done	1
7	the new target for a1c is 7	1
5	why is everyone still trying to get a1c down to 5  or  less	1
7%	you keep saying that the ada recently  raised their recommendation for a1c to 7%	1
6%	it is my understanding that the ada has never recommended a1c's below 6% &hellip; if you can show me something i would be very grateful	1
7	why not stop drugs at  a1c7  if that is safe	1
8	it looks to me like only when a1c 8 is or more that blood sugar becomes as dangerous than the drugs	1
5.5%	however if you eat a very low carb and high protein meal plan you may well be able to get your a1c down to 5.5% without meds as i did	1
5	without that information, you could get blood sugar of a1c of 5 and still have complications and heart disease	1
6.0	both neurologists i have seen recommended keeping a1c under 6.0 steve, you neurologists follow the american diabetes association	1
6	i am not saying having an a1c of 6 is bad	1
6	what i am saying is getting an a1c of 6 or less often can be only done with the drugs	1
5	how many diabetics have felt guilty because they couldn't get an a1c of 5	1
6	sue what you were told about your a1c being less than 6 is obsolete	1
5.2	over the past one year my a1c has been around 5.2	1
5.1	around ten days back my a1c was 5.1	1
5.5	my most recent a1c was 5.5	1

6	i'm currently taking it three times a week and maintaining hgb a1c &lt; 6	1
15	right now i'm at an a1c of 15ishh, high cholesterol, facing diabetic neuropathy which means they're hoping its not permanet but i get it a lot, my "women organs" have stopped working lol uhmm constant dehydration which leaves me in and out of the hospitol, kidney malfunctions (so far not permanet), my pancreas is seeming to resist the insulin now so i have to take pills too, my scars are not healing, so i'm starting to look like a lepard with all of them&hellip;and exspecially the ones on my feet lead my feet to swell and go numb leaving me out of work and off my feet for days	1

6.5%	clinical studies of diabetics have shown an increased mortality when an a1c goal of less than 6.5% is attempted (with medications)	1
5	but - clearly, many type 2 diabetics - can completely reverse their disease and lower thier a1c back to normal (often into the low 5's) with no medication at all	1

6.6	anne i usually stress about this, but my a1c has been at 6.6 since diagnosed	1
3	the benefits of measuring a1c is that is gives a more reasonable view of what's happening over the course of time (3 months), and the value does not bounce as much as finger stick blood sugar measurements	1

6.8	i was just given a 6.4 a1c down from 6.8	1
8.9	i am trying to bring my a1c from 8.9	1
6	the ultimate arbiter is to make sure you're a1c is no higher than the 6's	1
7	you have to be considered a controlled diabetic, although that isn't really defined i would imagine it means an a1c 7 or under	1
2	a1c down 2 months ago	1
16	i've been working hard at control since my "re"commitment to control after an a1c of 16&hellip;i don't get retested until the week before christmas so it'll be a challenge	1

3	so, the a1c is really the best way to see what is happening with your bgs over a 3 month period	1
6	your a1c is not good and you should try to get it below 6	1
3	unless you are in a special situation, to take your a1c more frequently than every 3 mos is wasting money	1
1	a1c is shorthand we use for a "glycosilated hemoglobin a1c" test	1
3	an a1c averages your blood glucose (bg) readings over the past 3 month period	1
3	enjoy it, and remember your a1c is an average of 3 months	1

7	although i don't know if they would ask for proof, they will ask if your diabetes is well controlled which means (for the most part) they will want an a1c under 7	1
1	donating blood artificially lowers your a1c which basically makes the a1c test useless as a doctor shouldn't use the result for anything	1
1	basically that means that although you may get a lower a1c, you will not see any benefit to it so it would be as if your a1c was higher	1

11.7	tml english when i was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in january, my blood sugar was 347 and my a1c was 11.7	1
5.9	in april my blood sugar readings were in the 90s and my a1c was 5.9	1
5.0	my latest blood sugar readings are in the 80s and 90s and my a1c is 5.0	1
8.2	i was diagnosed around aug 7th  with type one, my blood  sugar was 200 and my a1c was 8.2	1
6	my last a1c in january this year was 6 and there has been no change in my diet	1
5.4	a1c&hellip;is 5.4&hellip;doctor said my liver issue  has completely "corrected itself"&hellip;my liver couldn't possible be functioning any better	1
12.5%	the doctor (endochronologist) says it might be a smarter, healthier, easier lifestyle for me and help get my a1c down from 12.5%	1
6	to accomplish this, low carb diet, exercise, and continual monitoring, a1c in the 6';s, etc	1
5.8	my last a1c was 5.8 and that was when i had not been taking met	1
7.3	since an a1c is an average of your blood glucose numbers ("bg#s") if that 7.3 signifies a rather flat bg# with little variation up or down, that is fairly good	1
6.5	she had been having readings of about 250 to 300, yet her a1c was only 6.5	1
6	my eye doc said keeping the a1c below 6 wold prevent damage to the eyes from happening	1
14	when i was diagnosed in august of last year, my a1c was 14	1
5.5	last a1c was 5.5	1
6.7	it allows me to maintain my weight at 120 lbs (good for my 5' 3" frame) and my last a1c was 6.7, in a range that indicates good diabetes control	1
11.3	when i went to the emergency room my sugar level was 1147 and my a1c number was 11.3	1
6.9	my a1c is 6.9 but lately i have been feeling yucky	1
14.1	feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1	1
5.4	(pesky sugar alcohol though) i have a small portion and not on a daily basis and my last a1c was 5.4	1
12.4	when i was first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 12 years ago, my bg was 465 and my a1c was 12.4	1
6	i have not been on any diabetes meds for over 10 years, have a1c close to 6, and know i can do better than that with diet (only watching carb intake) and exercise (basically just walking more, and occasional swimming) alone	1
5.2	a1c has been as low as 5.2	1
6.2	best wishes harlen i've just been told this week that my a1cs have toppled over the threshhold, only 6.2, but still high enough that i have to make changes	1
5.7	prior to my learning that my a1cs had increased (used to be 5.7), i started having to take naps at work before i could drive home&hellip; talk about embarrassing&hellip; amen	1
13	well i have done that too i have type one and think i can get away with eating what ever i want then feel bad i have to get my sugar down but am not trying hard enough i hate to go to dr and get the a1c result 13 usualy i hope its better this time	1
6.7	my last a1c was 6.7  just this morning at the gas station on the way to work i bought a pastry and iced tea	1
8.4	last november my a1c came back at 8.4	1
8.5	i have not had an a1c below 8.5 for a decade	1
5.9	my a1c has climbed back up some (5.9 in march)	1
4	my a1c had increased .4 and no weight loss	1
5.9	lol&hellip; my next a1c was 5.9	1
7	now the ada has set a new standard for a1c of 7	1
7	i suspect that the reason they set the a1c at 7 is because it can be more easily achieved with less of their killer drugs	1
6	my a1c's are always below 6	1
7.2	last 3 month lab for a1c was 7.2	1
1	a1c doesn't measure blood sugar and home glucose meters don't test a1c	1
7.7	my a1c in june was up to 7.7	1
5	gary my doctor took me off of insulin today and my a1c is down by .5	1
5	my doctor recently did a a1c test and my level came back at 5	1
5	very sad&hellip; thank you all for your replies, i really appreciate it&hellip; as far as i'm concerned, an a1c of 5 is perfect	1
5	tell that silly doctor to test his own self for his a1c&hellip; if it's lower than 5 he's low&hellip; :)   that would explain why he's wrong here&hellip; hehehe	1
3	just a thought&hellip; also something else that doctors (maybe not gp's) know but won't talk about is that the a1c test shouldn't be the only or reliable guideline because it can vary up to 3 points	1
5.8	last time i did this i got my a1c down to 5.8	1
5.5	so far my last a1c was 5.5 and i have maintained a "normal" level of bg readings	1
4	each time my a1c went down we also adjusted meds down, and i was seeing my pcp quarterly so i never went more than 4 months	1
5.9	my last a1c was 5.9 and i will not risk my life by stop taking my metformin	1
6.5	an a1c of 6.5 is still in the diabetic range	1
5.5%	plus it managed to lower my bg levels so much i could discontinue them and achieve an a1c of 5.5%	1
6.5	anyways, the last a1c was 6.5 and i am trying to make my busy schedule as a grad student work out	1
6.1	but my a1c is 6.1 so that is good	1
6.2	no my bg's are good my a1c is 6.2 that's why i've been so confused on how i've been feeling lately thanks for all the info oh sorry i just notice this other post	1
7.5	best wishes harlen i did not have a complete conversation with her on the phone other than my repeated labs and a1c (7.5) led her to the diagnosis	1
7	in the meantime, let me just say that the ada is happy with any of us who keep our a1c readings below 7 as a goal and you are close to that already	1
6.4	my last a1c was 6.4 and i'm expecting it to be a bit lower this next time&hellip; this is what happened to me	1
15.7	my a1c level was 15.7	1
7.6	tml english my a1c test, came out to 7.6	1
17.4	when first admitted into the hospital my a1c was 17.4(yikes	1
5.9	but after my first checkup appointment my a1c has come down to a 5.9	1
5	my a1c's were never over 5 while i was on the pump&hellip;  my neuropathy pain in my feet and legs went almost completely away and i tended to do better with my diabetes care while i was on the pump	1
5.6	i found out some really great news yesterday in that i have been taken off the diabetes medications since i had an a1c level of 5.6 for the second time in a row	1
3	well my doc took my a1c 3 months ago	1
7.4	now since that date i have lowed my a1c level to 7.4	1
7.9	my a1c is 7.9 and she thinks it will lower it	1
13.9%	tml english when i was diagnosed with type 1 in december 2008, my a1c was 13.9%	1
5.7%	i did the mail away a1c from reli-on and it was 5.7%	1
4.9	when i get my testing to get the pump my a1c was 4.9	1
9.7	diagnosed in may with an a1c of 9.7	1
1	the nurse went over everything with me - she said my a1c was within normal range (hell, i didn't even know what an a1c was to ask more about it)	1
13	i have gained 20 pounds in the last 6 months and my a1c was 13 on my labs last week	1
12.8	i am not only type 2 dibetic, i am in end stage renal failure&hellip;ask you doctor if a renal diet might help lower your a1c, on renal diet my a1c dropped from 12.8 to 7.4 in a 90 days period&hellip;my a1c is now a constant 7.0 remember ask you doctor&hellip; i've had type 1 for 35+ years now and have been doing multiple (4) shots/day	2
11	tml english hey dc friends it's been awhile i know just got my new a1cs from my endo on the 11  this day was also my one year aniverseary  i can honestly say it's been one hell of a journey	1
5	insulin was the wake up call i needed and now i am down 60 lbs and my a1c has been in the low 5s for the last year	1
11.7	before diagnosis a1c was about 11.7	1
5.4	my a1c is 5.4 and i "control" bg with diet and exercise	1
12.45	i had a bg of 612 that day and an a1c of 12.45	1
5	hellip;that is the question i would be asking myself if i were in your boat&hellip;if you have great control and fully expected an a1c in the mid 5's because of it i wouldn't be too concerned about lows&hellip;if however it was a complete shocker i would be concerned&hellip;have you ever considered middle of the night testing	1
6.0%	i do know one can have lows affect one's bg levels as my late wife had regular bg levels in the above 200 mg/dl levels yet had an a1c at one point of 6.0%	1
6	mine stopped once my a1c got down to 6 howdy john i have "enjoyed" the burning neuropathy of my knees down to my toes for many years now	1
7.8	i mean my  doctor has increased my metformin to 1,000 mg per day,  when i ride my bike it makes my back hurt for two or three weeks so i try walking on the treadmill which aggrevates my right  ankle,  over three months my a1c is gone to a 7.8 lately i  h e tried the wii which really is not to good, now i'm back to  trying to walk and my bone in my buttocks is very painful	1
9	i am on insulin and my a1c was about 9	1
-	it takes time (generally a1c is done every 90 days) and faithful adherence to medications and dietary limitations, and exercising	1
10	tml english im going to the docter for a check up wenesday  at 9 am i saw my endocrinologist two weeks ago and while my a1c was high, i explained it by telling her about my two shots of cortisone and my 10 day supply of prednisone	1
11	i lost 62 lbs and my a1c went from 11	1
2	my priority right now is to keep my blood sugars as close to non diabetic as possible (huge diet change, exercise, medication) and that of course will lower my a1c and i am loosing weight because i am not eating all the calories i was eating before&hellip; i have polycystic ovarian syndrome (which makes me very insulin resistance - of course type 2 is also characterized by insulin resistance	1
1	hugs to all you can purchase the a1c test over the counter at walmart i have found it helps a1c test also otc at walgreens	1
6.4	also, great job on getting your a1c down to 6.4 that is awesome	1
7.6%	my mom's a1c results came back and her reading is 7.6%	1
6	by limiting my daily carbohydrate intake to 120 grams per day, i have been able to keep my hba1c's in the 6's (good diabetic control) and my retinopathy has not progressed nor needed any treatment	1
6.0	i have had diabetes for over 18 years, i feel good, have no complications, enjoy life, and maintain an a1c around 6.0	1
6.5	i hate the idea of something hanging on my body like that&hellip;my a1c has never been over 6.5 and i am extremely regimentied and organized	1
-	my a1c is a constant .65ish	1
5.5	everyone is different, but i found that i could control my blood sugars much better with injections, and because i wanted to keep my a1c at around 5.5 in order to have more children, i didn't feel like the pump was worth it at the time	1
13.3	tml english i just got my a1c results back and its a 13.3	1
5.6	my last a1c was 5.6	1
5.7	my last a1c was 5.7, so i will be eating this way for the remainder of my time here	1
6.8	the dr says we caught it early&hellip;my a1c was 6.8	1
4	god bless i can relate this disease can be very frustrating my bg goes anywhere from 27 to 300-400 at times gabbys advice is right on the mark i dont know about in your area but here in northwest ar we have a free health clinic if you qualify you can get your supplies for free or very low cost including an at home a1c test every 4 mos	1
6	my a1c is always below 6	1
10.0	i was diagnosed may 2007 with an a1c of 10.0	1
4.9	back in nov my a1c was 4.9, which i guess is really low, but still acceptible	1
6.9	my last hba1c was 6.9 and i'm hoping my next one will be lower	1
9.6%	tml english hi i'm rachel , im sixteen , i've had diabetes for about three years now , my recent a1c was a terrible 9.6%, quite honestly its embarrassing , and i do try really hard to normalize my sugars everyday	1
11%	my a1c last week was over 11%, and like you say it's quite frustrating	1
6	i've had type 1 since 1965 and have had no complications and keep my a1c in the 6's	1
5	when first diagnosed my goal was to get under 7, then to get under 6 (which i have been for the past 6 months) so while prioritizing my goals (i have other health concerns)  i started wondering how much benefit there would be in reducing my a1c to the low 5's (cost benefit analysis, if you will)	1
7.0	the goal is to keep the average bg low enough to keep you a1c below 7.0	1
7.0	the landmark dcct study proved that people with a1c's below 7.0 significantly reduce or prevent any complications	1
6	my a1c has been around 6 for many, many year now	1
8	20815-a1c-reading-8	1
8	he increased the lantus because my a1c went over 8	1
7.3	when i 1st found out i was type ii, my a1c was 7.3	1
6.2	:) oh, and btw, my last a1c about a week or so ago was 6.2	1
5.5	my may 2011 a1c was 5.5 and my bg numbers were at or very close to normal	1
6	but during the same time frame she had an a1c of 6	1
6	since her a1c was 6, she must have had some mighty low lows	1
1	so having a lower a1c may not be as healthy for us as having a little higher a1c and not be on the bg roller coaster	1
5.9	knowing how to count carbs is a lot of work ,a frend has a 12 year old and she will not let her mom or dad tuch her pump she dose her owne carb counting and her last a1c was 5.9 ,bettter then me grrrrrrrr lol  i was that gave her the book the calorei king ,she dose a great job of it	1
1	the third test, which is one that is frequently used to confirm a diabetes diagnosis, is known as the glycosylated hemoglobin test, hba1c test, or just a1c	1
-	i prefer to eat "unprocessed" foods whenever possible, and have maintained my 5.5 a1c for many months with this approach (as well as loosing over 40 pounds)	1
10.5	i was diagnosed 4 months ago with type 2 and had an a1c of 10.5	1
6.2	i got my labs back, and this time my a1c is 6.2 and my doc	1
10.8	my starting a1c was 10.8	1
5.0	my last a1c is 5.0	1
-	well to be honest with you techinally it didnt read 750 the exact thing it read is what you said high but with a good guess an from what all my ac1 30s r im sure at the very least its 750 well, according to that a1c you are running an average of around 800, so some times you are higher, and some times you are lower	1
8	last week i met a fellow who's a1c was in the mid 8 range just diagnosed and his doctor did only three things before sending him on his way	1
2%	i figured it was reasonably accurate because i can usually guess my a1c within .2% here is a link that you might find valuable	1
8.5	my a1c came back at 8.5, which was lower than i anticipated	1
15%	cuz i was never on levemir so i didn't know ) anyway, my a1c was at 15% my body was full of acid	1
7.2%	with some dancing and a lot of walking, and a good diet; i lost most of the weight and now my a1c is at 7.2%	1
9.6	when i had seen my endocrinologist several ago my a1c level was 9.6	1
5.3	my a1c was 5.3	1
9.8	my new doctor waited 3 months for an a1c (9.8) then put me on insulin	1
6.2	my a1c is 6.2	1
6.2	a1c of 6.2 is excellent for a diabetic	1
2	first i am a type 2 and i do not know what the rules are for type 1, but a 6.2 a1c for a type 2 is not bad	1
6.2	if my a1c was at 6.2 i know my doctor would take me off of metformin	1
7	now the ada has set a new standard for a1c of 7	1
7	i suspect that the reason they set the a1c at 7 is because it can be more easily achieved with less of their killer drugs	1
7%	god's best to you james baker howdy rosalie yes an a1c of 7% can be safe for the intermediate time, however what about for the long haul	1
7	what i suspect (cannot prove) is that nerve damage doesn't  necessarily occur at 6 and in my experience  not at a1c 7 over the long term under certain conditions	1
7	i have never seen a 3.6 as a low end for a1c, but as long as you are below 7, you are doing great	1
6.8	well my thought is that since the range is for non-diabetics a 3.6 would be possible for a non-diabetic who has a lot of low blood sugar experiences while it may not be an ideal glucose a1c it would be at the low end just as the 6.8 would be at the high "target" range	1
6	i was briefly put on metformin when my a1c went above 6 but it is lower or was at last check long ago and i was taken off the metformin	1
6.2	your numbers must be good to have your a1c down to 6.2	1
5	if you are under 60 and diet and exercise controlled t2, with your weight in a good place, you can extend your "honeymoon" phase as long as possible by keeping your numbers where you have them, and your a1c will probably continue to drop into the 5s	1
6	if you are over 60, your doctor may want you to have your a1c no lower than 6	1
4	jigsaw actually talked me into upping my carb intake a bit as well from my extreme cuts, and even though i felt like i was cheating, my a1c went down .4 points	1
6.8	hga1c has never been over 6.8	1
5.5	because my a1c was 5.5, my doctor let me get off metformin	1
3	tml english hi everyone i just wanted to say how important it is to have your a1c test done at least 3 times a year	1
6%	the closer a diabetic can keep their a1c to 6%, the better their diabetes is in control	1
6.4	my a1c test was up though at 6.4	1
5.5%	a1c-5.5%  dr	1
4	i have my a1c test done 4 times a year	1
5.7	my last a1c was 5.7	1
-	i've been lucky, and know that even though a1c is low, and hdl is very high at 70, lipid panel is within normal limits, all is not well, as creatinine levels are going up	1
3	my doctor checks my a1c every 3 mos	1
2.4	in 3 months time my a1c dropped 2.4 points	1
8.2%	so, my a1c was 8.2%	1
6.6	my last a1c was 6.6 which indicates good control	1
6.1	there was a calculator somewhere online (i've lost the link now) that told me that based on my average daily bg readings that i'd have an a1c of 6.1 if i was tested that day	1
5.0	and the only way that my hmo will do the surgery is if i bring my a1c down to a 5.0	1
2	but if sir harlan is correct &amp; it does take 3 mos 4 the a1c 2b lowered, i guess it can't be any quicker than that	1
6	great diet&hellip;i've been doing the same thing roughly for many years and my a1c has been in the 6's	1
-	cut the carbs and it will still take time to get it down  an a1c is a 90 day test or what it has ben over the last three months  best wishes harlen thanks, sir harlan	1
3	hello and welcome to dc family very cute baby i thought i would join group  nice to meet u thank you that is my granddaughter she just turned two jan 2 2011 alan i like red do you  have type 2 , what do people normally speak about here yes i am t2 most talk about anything they want mostly the problems with there meds or diabetes or doctor or weight  alan i have togo to doctor tommorow just for a checkup or a1c alan same 3 month checkup check all levels ok mine is in march alan good luck on app	1
14.1	feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1	1
6.1	ive never had an a1c that low but once it was 6.1 and my doctor said i must have cheated lol&hellip;good for you tho	1
14.1	feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1	1
14	my first a1c was 14	1
15	god bless, mary my first a1c was a 15	1
1	an a1c test is very important and so is knowing what the test result numbers mean, listed below are links to information and a video clip that explains the a1c test result numbers:    http://www	1
1	om/a1c-and-you/about-a1c/a	1
10%	even you a1c can be off by 10%	1
2	my a1cs have been good with the one touch so far so are the other 2 no good	1
14	my potassium levels were critically low at 2.3 and my a1c came back at 14	1
5.4	my a1c last month was 5.4	1
6	a1c in the 6's is fine	1
1	do i keep on doing what i am doing and see how low i can get my a1c or do i cut back on my insulin and keep my a1c around where it is now having had the same question, i'll tell you what i would do, and what i have actually done	1
5.4	my last a1c was 5.4 and my endo said she doesn't want me going any lower	1
5.8	all i can say is that being on the pump has been nothing short of a miracle for me (less lows and my hba1c two weeks ago was 5.8)	1
2	as you can tell, i am new here and new to the diagnosis (about 3 weeks ago after a fgt, a1c followed by a ogtt i was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes)	1
8.8	my glucose levels were as follows:   fasting 155 1/2 hr 277 1 hr 362 2 hr 369 3 hr 243   and my a1c was 8.8	1
6	people  tend to forget the goal:  an a1c in the 6's	1
7	if your a1c is 7 or more, you have to pull the emergency switch a go no-carb which will get you down (unless your meds are totally wrong)	1
6	since my a1c was in the 6's, i felt comfortable continuing my low-carb approach	1
8.6%	i am a male 43, i am been diagnosed in 1st week of jan 2013, surfaced in my physicals,since it was 204 , doc ordered for a1c it came up at 8.6%	1
9.6	my a1c is 9.6 last week	1
5.5	keeping my bg's close to normal levels, and have lost weight, and my most recent a1c (may) is 5.5	1
-	there was a lady in the hospital the day before younger than myself who's a1c was 1500 she died the same day she was brought to the hospital	1
5.7	my a1c was 5.7 last month when my doctor checked	1
7.1	i was dx in oct 2010 with an a1c of 7.1	1
5.7	as of nov 2011, my a1c was down to 5.7 and i expect it to be even lower given my recent averages of daily bs	1
6.1	my a1c is 6.1, not my bmi	1
13	i got complacent over that time and my a1c got all the way up to like 13 and a temporary doctor put me on insulin	1
5.4	my lowest a1c was at 5.4 and would have stayed there if i didn't have a life changing event which gave me so much stress that i started eating wrong again	1
7	stress was running my life and through that my a1cs popped up to the 7s and i was extremely unhappy for that	1
5.8	i test about 6-8 times a day and my a1c is 5.8	1
-	tml english i had 8.1 a1c and high bs up to 290	1
5.5	a few yrs ago i was having some hypo feelings and a1c was done at that time 5.5	1
5.5	i was told i didn't need to test again after a second a1c came back 5.5	1
6.1	recently i had another a1c done and it came back as 6.1	1
6.0	my calculated a1c was only 6.0   long story longer	1
5.8	when he told me that my fasting blood sugar was 106 and my a1c was 5.8	1
5.4	he redid blood work and in the 4 almost 5 weeks that i was changing my diet i did get some number changes the fasting blood sugar only went down 3 points to 103 but the a1c went down to 5.4 so it was doing some good	1
6.5	tml english so, my first a1c was 6.5	1
5.7	my second a1c was 5.7	1
5.4	that was all i needed to lose, i am at ideal weight now, i got off the pills after losing that, a year ago, and my last a1c was 5.4	1
13.8	my starting a1c when i was diagnosed was 13.8 so i am hoping the diet and exercise can help me bring mine down also	1
7.1	or just a diet and excercise i need a better diet my a1c was at 7.1	1
6.0	my doctor tells me any a1c below 6.0 is a non diabetic level	1
4	i have a type 2 friend who has had several a1c's in the high 4's	1
6	i am type1 and would love to get my a1c's lower than 6	1
6	if your a1c is less than 6, you are probably experiencing acute lows (my biggest enemy) because you are having to correct with humalog/novalog which is like carefully handling dynamite to me&hellip;  i don't believe you can stay in that range without the lows with many carbs and have sustainable weight loss	1
6	i'm not against a vegan diet, but it's benefit pales in comparison to the benefit of maintaining an a1c in the 6's	1
6	i've finally gotten my a1c's back in the 6's but have to deal with some scary lows	1
5.5	my experience with very low carb, high protein for the past 6 months  keeping my bgs close to the normal range without insulin or other meds and losing about 40 lbs, and my may 2011 a1c at 5.5 would beg to differ with hope warshaw	1
5.5	now i am off of insulin, had success with an experemental eating plan, and kept my blood glucose close to "normal" and my last a1c was 5.5	1
12.6	my a1c was 12.6	1
5.9	and i just ame back from my dr 2 days ago had an a1c of 5.9 correct its all about carbs not the sugar however sugar raises you bg faster just like fruit juice hey, you just pick yourself back up and it'll work out	1
4.9	tml english thrilled with myself&hellip;latest a1c is 4.9&hellip;without meds&hellip;nice&hellip;liver function	1
1	tml english here we are back on a1c again - has anyone any idea how how the a1c chart goes	1
7	keeping your a1c at 7 or below helps	1
5.7%	tml english yesterday the 24th was my birthday and i got my a1c back which came in at 5.7%	1
14	my last a1c was 14, dr	1
14.1	feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1	1
1	just go back and start with the basics you did when you had lower a1cs  if you do, next time you do the a1c, it may be back down	1
10.0	the dentist states my a1c must be under 10.0	1
6.5	my a1c is 6.5 because i stay disiplined	1
7	my blood suger was alright, my a1c went up to 7 and it started getting more difficult to control it	1
10	my a1c then went up to 10	1
7	every six months now that my a1c is below 7	1
7	after 52 weeks, 74 percent of all patients achieved an a1c of 7 percent or less &mdash; the target the ada recommends for good glucose control	1
5.5	turned out his a1c was down to 5.5 and the dosage of metformin was no longer needed	1
1	i am far more concerned about my a1c than i am about my cholesterol and i can do a1c tests at home if i want to	1
4.5	take care it sounds like you may have low blood sugar to let everyone know im still unsure whats going on my dr did a lay to sit to stand blood pressure test an a1c test wich came back 4.5 he said thats low he took me off my januvia and told me to go really strct on my diat,hes not sure whats going on im seing him again in the morning	1
6	do you think if i can have my bs's in the 100-110 range in mornings and a a1c of 6 or less, my doc will hold off on meds	1
11.2	your a1c of 11.2 means that you&#39;ve been running very high blood sugars for months	1
7.1	when my a1c test comes back as 7.1 and the doctor tell me that's really good, i say bs, i just made myself have a no	1
7.1	when my a1c test comes back as 7.1 and the doctor tell me that's really good, i say bs, i just made myself have a no	1
7.7	when i test levels its about 104 to 191(higest i seen) your a1c is very good, a lot better than mine at my last check (7.7), but your bg's look pretty much the same as mine	1
6.8	at that time my a1c was 6.8	1
6.0	my new a1c is 6.0	1
6	anything under 180 will give you an a1c in the 6's which is all you need	1
3	dropping your a1c a full point in 3 months seems like a great step in the right direction to me	1
6.9	my last a1c was 6.9 and i was very happy about that	1
5.5	my newest a1c was 5.5 but i would have never guessed it was going to be that good	1
7.0	my last a1c was 7.0 and i'm hoping to get it lower	1
10.7	i was diagnosed type 2 in march 2015, a1c 10.7	1
6.2	tml english had great news today, my hba1c is at 6.2	1
9.0%	my a1c is 9.0%, not good	1
-	i pray this has made sense to you and that you can get your a1c in a better place in another 90 days	1
6.1	my sugars are pretty good, my last a1c was 6.1	1
6.0	his a1c is now 6.0 and he does splurge from time to time	1
6.9	unfortunately, because of a stent in my heart, the doc would like to see me with an a1c of less than 6.9	1
5.6	brought my a1c down to 5.6	1
4.8%	i used to drink cinnamon tea at least once daily and my hba1c went down to 4.8%	1
5.9	when my doc saw my bg test diary and a1c (latest is 5.9), he said, "there is no need for you to test everyday&hellip;you're just torturing yourself"  he told me to test once a week	1
6.0%	my a1c reading was 6.0% howdy larry  welcome to dc	1
13.5	i was in complete denial&hellip;   then the realization came home one day when my bg was 478 and my a1c was 13.5	1
3	an a1c is an averae of what your blood sugars have been for the past 3 months	1
5.8	if you managed to keep an average of 104, your a1c would be about 5.8	1
7%	finally, a recommendation comes that will send a patient with an impaired glucose or fasting glucose tolerance, or an a1c in the pre-d range to a qualified weight loss program to get rid of 7% body weight	1
17.5	hen i found out i was a type 1 diabetic and almost died with an a1c of 17.5 she found out i was sick, she called me i didnt know what to think i was happy, durring the call she made the comment ill never for get,aww, its to bad this has happened to you you were such a pretty girl ,its to bad you lost it all, i didnt know what to think out of pure rage and sadnees i hung up cried for days havent spoke to her sence, but on days like to day this really hurts,im not really sure why i will never be or mean any thing to her, but im very glad you have some one for you i hope you all have a very wounderful mothers day, some people take no responsibility for anything really	1
6.0	after retiring and teaching part time for a few years i was having good blood sugar control with a1c's below 6.0	1
6	nice to know i can have the rare "splurge" &hellip; it will be interesting to see what the a1c in november comes in at &hellip; anything under 6 and i will be happy	1
9	a1c was above 9 last time and i just felt like crying	1
7%	the american diabetes association recommends an a1c of 7% or lower	1
5.6	and i am maintaing a a1c of 5.6	1
12.3	my triglycerides were 1864, cholesterol was 434, a1c was 12.3	1
6.3	my last a1c 6.3	1
14.1	feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1	1
3	well, i am now 30 pounds lighter than last year (5'11" and currently at 169) so i am hopeful that my a1c (average blood glucose over 3 months) is in a decent range	1
7.5	my a1c is now 7.5 (as of last thursday)	1
6.9	weighed 112 pounds and a1c was at 6.9	1
7.3	blood test cholesterol went down but a1c went up to 7.3 on the diet	1
6.4	so i modified my diet and my a1c is now down to 6.4 - did a home test this month	1
6.4	i do not want to be on diabetes meds - is it bad to have an a1c at 6.4 and not be on meds	1
6.9	my a1c was only 6.9 when i was eating what i wanted	1
6	best med for diabetes is straight out insulin &hellip; least amount of side effects &hellip; generally an a1c in the 6's is considered good for a person with diabetes and reflects good control	1
6.5	my a1c has been at 6.5 for quite sometime and i am on medication	1
6.9	my first a1c was 6.9 and immediately my doctor wanted to put me on meds	1
6.4	if your a1c is 6.4 already you do not need meds you really think i may be able to get away with not taking meds at this time	1
6	my a1c also was off the charts once i got to the doc 6 weeks ago	1
-	i got the results from the doctors office about my a1c yesterday and it took me this long to come to terms about what i was told i have to do till my next visit on august 31st	1
5.5	what i don't understand is my a1c was 5.5, so how can my blood sugars be that high	1
-	all i can say dee is you might have had some mighty powerful  lows you came through since the a1c is an average of your bg numbers for 90 days or so	1
6.5	my bride jem had bg levels which were at times 300 to 400, yet her a1c  was only 6.5	1
7.5	he said come back in 6 months a1c 7.5	1
6	it focused on maximum a1c reduction versus maximum weight loss&hellip;it is my doctor's opinion that focusing on lowering your a1c to under 6 should be a diabetics number one priority&hellip;while also trying to slowly lose weight&hellip;i argued that getting to ones ideal weight/bmi should be the priority while keeping your a1c under 7&hellip;then once your weight is gone&hellip;focus more on lowering your a1c&hellip;i based my opinion on the fact that extra weight in and of itself is detrimental to insulin resistance&hellip;we went back and forth for hours&hellip;opinions please	2
5.9	so, with my last a1c a 5.9, i'm refocusing and making losing weight a priority	1
7	at least your doctor didn&#39;t say it was okay to just douse yourself with drugs and an a1c of 7 was fine	1
6	to tell some one on insulin to shoot for a a1c of under 6 is down right dangerous	1
1	s opposed to focusing on a1c which is just one health marker that measures one symptom of diabetes&hellip;my doctor thinks the weight issue might be too overwhelming for a newly diagnosed diabetic to deal with&hellip;and because a1c can be brought into line much quicker than weight feels it is the way to go	1
6.0	i forgot to add my a1c 6.0 when first diagnosed, i dove in with both feet	1
7	isn't it true that keeping your a1c at 7 or below, you are out of the high risk category	1
5	true&hellip;i am exactly 1 pound from my goal weight and have maintained my a1c under 5&hellip;they did go hand and hand	1
6.0	i maintained an a1c of 6.0 with a combination of the atkins diet, and exercise for a few years	1
6.0	over the last 20 years, i have maintained an a1c of 6.0 with little variation	1
2	got my wife looking for the ones ive trid 1 is the beef fajitas and the beef strogan off a crook pot started making several doctors appointmenst and illl be looking to see the nutrinist so i know the amount deitary and cals i need to work on getting my a1cs to norm for a t2 wonderful	1
5	really luv, there is a way to get your a1c down into the 5s, but i won't tell you simply because it is so very dangerous to do	1
-	just reduce your carbohydrate intake and let you a1c come down naturally within the 90 days required	1
5.4	congratulations on your a1c of 5.4, keep up the great work	1
11	when i was first diagnosed, my a1c number was 11	1

7%	hi christine,   the american diabetes association (ada) recommends an a1c of less than 7%	1

12	i learned so much about diabetes in the last 11 or so years &hellip; one thing i've learned is once a diabetic always a diabetic except gestational diabetes &hellip; if you are taking extraordinary steps to control your diabetes causing the symptoms to go into remission , that's awesome and i congratulate you &hellip; keep it up &hellip; also if you have gestational diabetes you will get diabetes one day&hellip;might not be right away well my doctors did because my a1c hasnt changed in many months, i have had diabetes for 12 years so am not stupid and yes i know it can maybe come back	1
6	after 46 years of type 1, i aim for a bg of 80 to 180 and end up with an a1c in the 6's	1
5.9	initially, this resulted in getting my a1c down to 5.9&hellip;but, it's slowly inched back up as i slackened on the carb control	1

5.5	may i suggest a meal plan (i dislike the word "diet") on which which i lost 65 lbs last year, had an a1c of 5.5, normalized my blood glucose (bg) readings and did it without resorting to diabetes meds of any kind	1
5	per his chart, an average of 90 over the 2 to 3 months covered by an a1c would translate to a 5 like locarb said	1
1	as you know, the a1c looks at your overall blood sugar levels, and since we can't test our blood sugar every few minutes throughout the day, the a1c gives a good overall picture of blood sugar management	1
6.4	my a1c is 6.4	1
6.5	from the information i have my a1c should be below 6.5	1
6.5	i was diagnosed a year ago with an a1c of 6.5	1

1	the a1c used to be done through a blood test done in a dr's office or a lab, but recent years a personal a1c meter is available fo consumers using a meter and a strip, much like a glucometer	1
1	so the only way one can get an a1c reading, is through a blood test done through a dr's office, or through reading from an a1c meter	1
19	i had a1c tested on november 19th and urine came back positive for microalbuminurea (kidney malfunction, could be earlier stage of kidney failure or kidney disease)	1

8	i would love to get my a1c down to below 8	1
5	during that time i have lost 110 pounds and kept my a1c below 5	1
3.3	i once knew a young lady that was diagnosed adult onset type 1, and she kept on taking her insulin on an empty stomach, or when she had very very little to eat&hellip;i know this probably does not apply to you, but i am still astounded at what happened to her&hellip;after taking her insulin with no food in her, or very little food for a whole year, her a1c fell to a 3.3	1
3	and will it greatly affect my a1c to be high for 3 hrs every once in a while	1
7.8	however, when i was first diagnosed my a1c was 7.8	1
6.3	until 2012, my a1c was an average of 6.3	1
6.2	i eat whatever i want and my last a1c was high, and that was a 6.2; it's all about how you approach your disorder	1

8	i am still waiting on an a1c below 8&hellip;maybe soon	1
6.9	my last a1c was 6.9 and i'd like to get it lower which means i'll most likely have to cut down on my daily carbs and/or increase my exercise level&hellip;living with diabetes is a constant challenge and balancing act	1
7	if you understand the physiology, you know that not achieving the goal of an a1c below the 7's, is very bad	1
6.4	tml english my latest a1c was 6.4	1
6.5	with an a1c of 6.5 you would be considered well controlled	1
5.7	my last a1c was 5.7	1
10.3%	fp=162mg/dl pp2=198mg/dl hba1c=10.3%, a big surprise for me, as nobody want to be a diabetic, and i was one of them	1

5.7%	my latest status (14 feb 15) is: fp = 85mg/dl pp2 = 90mg/dl hba1c = 5.7% please advise me if i am on right track	1

12.6	my a1c was 12.6 in december and i am totally insulin dependent	1
3	he says he doesn't want the extra site even though his a1c every 3 months has been going up	1

8	i'm on track for an a1c of about 8 in the next few months	1
5.0	as a non-insulin dependent type 2 my goal is to get my a1c to under 5.0 (ultimately) and to be off all meds controlling my diabetes through diet and exercise	1
5.6	i was dianogsed 26 months ago, and i have no idea how long i had it, just that the doctor said it was caught 'early' i asked her how they knew it was caught early, and she said because my a1c was 5.6 and i am interested in reversing, but while i am doing real well, i have not reversed it yet	1
7	my doctor ups my visits to every 3 months if my a1c is over 7	1
6.6	i will be trying this out this week, i want my a1c lower than 6.6, so am hesitating to lower meds, but also sometimes feel like i am constantly eating to avoid lows	1
6.8	your a1c is really good, i'm trying to get mine below 6.8	1
5.5	my last a1c is 5.5 by just what i eat and excercise	1
4.9	i'm usually 80-125 also by my a1c (last check) was 4.9	1

5.8%	only being diagnosed with type 1 for 5 months now, and only on lantus (long lasting insulin 10 u in am &amp; 10 u in pm) my first ever a1c results were 5.8% yay	1
5.6	my a1c is 5.6 but my doctor says full blown diabetes	1
5.4	i had barely failed the 2 hr glucose test with a 205 &amp; 210, had fastings in upper 70 to lower 80 and hga1c of 5.4	1
6.8	my a1c was at 6.8	1
5.6	and as of last month the dr has taken me off all diabetic meds&hellip; 1 full years of a1c of 5.6 or less  yea	1
5.5	my a1c is 5.5 last may	1
6.9	my a1c was 6.9 but with all the lows i have been having i know that is not a true reading	1
6.1	tml english found out today that my a1c is down to 6.1	1
7	now of course, i'm not entirely thrilled with this number as i figured all my efforts should have resulted in an a1c under 7, but even as my physician said, this is still new for me, and it will still take some time/medication/diet/exercise and the magical combination thereof for me to hit my mark&hellip;but i will do it	1
5.5	my a1c are 5.5 or less for three years	1
1	my a1c was just 1 tenth of a point below tha diabetic level	1
14.5	she ran lots of blood work, my a1c was 14.5, and last week she started me on insulin	1
6.5	testing is key and aim for 80 to 180 bg which usually ends up with an a1c of 6.5	1
5.9	my last a1c was last week and it is 5.9	1
5.7	this month my a1c was 5.7	1
6.3	my a1c was 6.3	1
6.3	an a1c of 6.3, congratulations	1
2	won't get an a1c for 2 months so hoping its good	1
2	here's to a1c numbers that will please you in 2 months	1
18	, here's to good numbers (a1c) on the 18th of july	1
5.5	my last a1c was 5.5	1
-	i don't think i had an a1c so low since before i was dx'd in 1995	1
7.5	just found out my a1c was 7.5 - anyone know what this means	1
6.5	i was diagnosed a year ago with an a1c of 6.5	1
0.5%	punkiedoo a1c test has a error range of about 0.5%	1
6.5	i'm quite sure my a1c was accurate at 6.5	1
6.4	radically change my eating, exercised religiously and one month later no glucose in my urine, a1c was 6.4	1
7.3	last hgba1c was 7.3 and started on metformin	1
-	15345-is-anyone-tested-for-the-a1c-more-often-than-every-90-days	1
-	i have had the fruitose test and that seems within range   has anyone been tested for the a1c more often than every 90 days	1
6	if the 200s are accurate readings, you also have to be having some really low bgs at times when you aren't testing to get and a1c under 6	1
3	by contrast, the a1c is protected from outside influences because of the serile blood draw (when done by the doctor or lab), so you get a real look at what's happening to your blood cells over the previous 3 months	1
5.5	my type ii a1c is down to 5.5 as of last week&hellip;but my blood pressure and bad cholesterol are up and now i've got to take meds for that too	1
6.0	through classes i learned that in our bodies&hellip;the protein attaches to the carbs and helps take them out of our bodies thus helping fewer carbs to be absorbed&hellip;and raising our blood sugar level&hellip;it really has worked for me and i have lost 22lbs in the past 5/6 months (and i didn't starve or feel deprived)&hellip;and my recent a1c was 6.0	1
5.5	i've finally been zeroing in on things that work using that approach&hellip;latest a1c is down to 5.5 this week&hellip; i've finally got some good results	1
14.1	i am praying for you and your child   blessings to you and yours   james feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1	1
5.3	that doesn't  give me a lot of "wiggle room" but my last a1c was 5.3, so i guess i will try to stick with it	1
5	my a1c levels are usually in the low 5's	1
3	we&#39;ve never used one as we get an a1c test at each clinic appointment (every 3 months)	1
1	john, hi i'm trisha, i don't mean to sound dumb, but what is a1c test trisha, an a1c is an average of you're blood glucose levels over a period of time	1
10.9	but after 3 months of no meds my a1c was 10.9	1
6%	if you can get your a1c level at or below 6% it would be good	1
5.5	(i had an a1c of 5.5 for quite a while by following a specific meal plan	1
5.6	my a1c is 5.6 which isn't bad, dr thinks neroptahy damage of the feet and legs started when i was a prediabetic for so long	1
5.0	if i were you i would drive my a1c to 5.0 or lower, there is nothing to lose&hellip;you wanna do this before damage become permanent, the longer you wait, the less fully you can recover	1
6.0	that, along with my basal and bolus insulins, resulted in my having a1c's below 6.0 soon after the start of the new century	1
-	my a1c's before the mid 1990s were much much higher	1
3	cde   "overall diabetes control is based on the a1c, which is an average of approximately 3 months worth of blood sugars that includes the extreme highs and lows	1
12	her a1c was over 12 at one point, but she has been able to get it down quite a bit by just changing how she eats carbs	1
10.4	thats a good idea my bg this morning was 84 i have a new doctor and he warn me about my a1c mine is at the moment is 10.4 way to high so he has me keeping a log of everything i eat and the times also i am testing more	1
6.9	my a1c was still at a 6.9, but i still felt crappy from the inconsistency	1
2	no not on insulin just taking 2 gliclazide a day jigsaw cant do a1c yet as only been diagnosed 2 and bit months should be due blood test soon so will ask gp xxx	1
6	i have had a 5.6 a1c for the last 6 months and my doctor has not taken me off any thing	1
6	so an uncontrolled diabetic is where you can't keep your sugar in the range that the doctors were set, but in the last 5 to 10 yrs, they started using a1c, all recommendations are it around 6	1
5.1	my a1c  is 5.1 and i am not on any insulin or pills	1
-	and it ssmall nobody bwill ever know you have it on and ytou can take it off for tow hrs ect&hellip; its so much better then shooting your self up plus ytour a1c leveles will be better think about it im 33 still young i go out drink ect&hellip; but evrything is managable with the pump what we do want is for melissa is to live  and what we do not want is to promote her life threatening life style	1
17	upload pic of pump to pics check it out if you want more info you can ask if you want ill give my number if you want look its the best thing that happend i used to shoot up about 16 times a day my a1c leves used to be 17 once i got on the pump my numbers droped you see results right away and all insurences pay for pumps i know alot with this anyway good luck if anything you can ask what ever done alot now on the right path k bye hey guys&hellip; don't worry about me&hellip; i know i can not do this on my own and i'm heading to detox soon	1
6	the bottom line is control, and keeping that a1c in the 6's	1
6	if your a1c is 6 or less, you're fine	1
5.5	james baker   (latest a1c is 5.5) wow	1
6.2	my most recent a1c was 6.2	1
6.2	my a1c is 6.2, still on meds &amp; try hard to keep it regulated	1
7	i've been diabetic since jan 2010 my first aic  was 13%  my second 8.9% my a1cm was 7	1
8	someone who's had uncontrolled diabetes for a long time might have an a1c level above 8 percent	1
6.5	a1c level of 6.5 percent or higher on two separate tests indicates you have diabetes	1
7	for most people who have previously diagnosed diabetes, an a1c level of 7 percent or less is a common treatment target	1
6	a new study shows increased risk of heart attacks for people with a1c below 6	1
-	a 4.1 a1c averages out to be about a 70 (mg/dl) which on some scales is considered "optimal"	1
4.1	"lowest" should say: later, cathy you a1c is 4.1&hellip; that's amazing	1
6.0%	an a1c level of 6.0% or greater represents a high risk for diabetes mellitus	1
3	your a1c is a 3 month test to check blood sugar levels in your body over a period of time	1
5.5	so today when i got the mail i was so happy when i saw that my a1c was 5.5	1
7.0	great a1c just keep working at keeping it under 7.0	1
5.5	awesome a1c 5.5&hellip;you are doing great	1
6.5	but he wants to see me get my a1c below 6.5 before checking	1
5.5	also i don't know what you consider a "good" a1c  but for quite a while mine was 5.5 (which i consider good) and my neuropathy continued unchanged	1
6	the neurologist said i should keep my a1c below 6 and start and exercise program (hoping to get some physical therapy set up when i next see my primary care	1
6.2	my a1c was 6.2 but&hellip;my potassium was off the charts high	1
6	it was worth the wait and the fight to get to see one as i have finally over the past 2 years since working with one got life back to normal and a1c staying below 6	1
6.0	i have maintained an a1c around 6.0 for the last twenty years, and i have never felt better	1
6	the main objective to stay healthy is to maintain an a1c in the 6's and maintain a body weight somewhere near where you should be	1
6.7	;dr atkins proved it in many cases, and i proved it to myself&hellip;152 last check with an a1c of 6.7&hellip;plus you're losing weight (fat) in the process	1
6	goal is to get a1c below 6 by end of year	1
7.2	wtg getting your a1c down to 7.2	1
11.7	after 2 of them a1c was at 11.7 my experience with steroid shots (had them for a torn rotator cuff) is that they tend to elevate your bgl for about a week	1
6.0	tml english my doctor wants my a1c below 6.0 since that is a nondiabetic level	1
7.0	(3) but by far the most important reason is this: a vast majority of t2 people have a1c values far, far above 7.0, and ada has decided not to set the bar so high that nearly everybody fails to reach it	1
6.9	my last a1c was 6.9 and my doctor and i were thrilled because it has taken along time to get there	1
6.0	i only test once a day (unless i'm sick) but seldom hit 130 and my a1cs run 6.0	1
13	my a1c started coming down and would actually register, at that time it was 13 which is not good but better	1
8.1	as if today my a1c is down to 8.1 and my doctor keeps adjusting my insulin	1
6.5	your 9 is your a1c and 6.5 is when my doc starts treating his wife is diabetic and he has been treating for years and has good rep with diabetic treatment	1
11	my last a1c level was 11	1
3	the "9" you're talking about if your a1c results, the average blood sugar over a 3 month period	1
8	my a1c is now at an 8 which i'm not to happy about	1
1	probably the 9 is a hemoglobin a1c number (often referred to simply as "a1c")	1
12.6	my a1c is awful, the highest it has ever been, at a 12.6	1
11	i'm currently trying to bring my a1c dow from a little over 11&hellip; um no	1
6.0	i have since controlled my bg and my a1c for the has been 6.0 today, there is no douth that i am diabetic even if i test in the normal ranges	1
3	not without medicine and not without watching what i eat though have they checked your a1c level, this tells what your blood sugar has been doing for the past 3 months	1
5.4	my last a1c was 5.4	1
5.4	joni, an a1c of 5.4 is good	1
6.3	i leave room in my diet for an occasioanl "sugary" item as a treat and my a1c is 6.3 so for me my approach is working	1
7	i am pretty sure i would be much better off today had i been made aware that a more aggressive approach may have been more appropriate (or even possible) rather than the standard "cut down on the sugar, eat 150 grams of carbs per day, get your a1c under 7 and you will be fine" bs that it seems the vast majority of physicians are dispensing	1
6.5	my first a1c was 6.5	1
7.6	tml english hey guys got lab work back wed a1c down to 7.6 i am back on right track ,also all other numbers came down also ,keep me in your prayers have great day congratulations	1

5.9	i am on 3 oral meds and 1 injection of lantus per day, and my last a1c was 5.9, which my doctor said was to low	1
7.1	both parents were type2 so i should not be surprised&hellip;i was careful - i exercised, ate fairly healthy but another medical problem caused me to be put on a bland all carb and protein diet- thus making my a1c 7.1	1
6	a1c of 6 is when he starts meds	1
5.5%	i also with that meal plan had discontinued my  twice daily nph injection, kept my bg (blood glucose) between 80 to 130 mg/dl, achieve an a1c of 5.5%, i offer my meal plan to anyone who asks for it	1
16	i get keytones with extreme highs, almost admitted for ketoacidosis several times&mdash;-i go to the hospital a year and a half ago&mdash;they took my a1c, said it was 16, and i had keytones	1
5.8	now, my a1c is 5.8&mdash;-too low for me&mdash;-weird, very very weird&hellip;am i not eating enough carbs	1

3	your a1c number gives your average blood glucose for the past 3 months	1
5	anyway, i mentioned that i would  just rather take a higher dose of glymiperide&hellip;which i was on previously&hellip;but she said that  my a1c was down 5 points and i should stay on the levemir	1
9	i began see a new doctor recently since my a1c was 9 and he began treating me aggressively	1
6.8	my last a1c was 6.8	1
6.8	with insulin a1c last time was 6.8 you know the risk its up to you ,is it worth it to you to take that risk	1
6	yet during that same time period she achieved an a1c of 6	1
-	if my a1c is still good after two months the metformin will be cut to 250 twice daily	1
5	i can't imagine an a1c below 5	1
7.5	my a1c has been 7.5 for many years	1
4.8	if your a1c is 4.8, you should be able to do it with  a very low carb diet	1
9	my a1c was 9 and the dr	1
6.0	he (the endo) stated that since my a1c was down below 6.0 now, that i really only needed to test once or twice a day	1

2	i've been on the omnipod since october - my a1c dropped .2 in the first month	1
1	some things that have helped me improve my a1c using a pump:   1	1
8.9	o the doctor sets up these classes to go to and gave me insulin to take but he didnt give me needles and they canceled the class so my a1c was 8.9 and i still havent gotten any meds to help so must be they dont care about it to much	1
13	my a1c was 13 when i was diagnosed and i felt really really sick	1
12	i'm type 1 and i know my a1c is like 12	1
11.4	cholesterol total: 208 triglycerides: 142 hdl cholesterol: 37 a1c: 11.4 i know, it's bad	1
5.5	that menu has been keeping my bgs in the normal range, and my last a1c in may was 5.5	1
6.1	drinking this and being good on my other stuff has helped me go from a 10.5 a1c to a 6.1 and four months and shed some of those extra pounds	1
6.9	my last a1c was 6.9 i think	1
13.8	since having the baby i am 21 lbs lighter than i was when i got pregnant and my a1c is now a 13.8	1
11	:) i was never really determined to do well with my t1diabetes until my last a1c came back 11 i knew it was time to get it together sorry about your feet hurting but when an amazing job you have done	1
1	a nurse told me my a1c a few yrs ago and said i as in like a remission but i would not always stay that way well i have for a few yrs now at least i think so, my numbers are pretty much the same, a1c still the same, and i exercise daily	1
8.5	i feel much better but definitely have to work on my eating habits as my a1c was 8.5 this past testing which is the highest i've ever been	1
7	just remember to check your blood sugar (b/s) @ least twice a day, and try and keep it below 200 and your hga1c under 7 &amp; you should be just fine	1
3	sorry one last item not everyone agrees but your a1c over a period of 3 months is more important than the bs readings	1
14.7	his a1c was 14.7	1
13	tml english hi all, i went to the diabetic clinic today and they told me that my a1c was at 13	1
5	the post got cut off it should continue to say was &mdash;&mdash;-         fasting less than  100 1 hr after food  less than  120 2 hr after food  less than  140 a1c in low 5s	1
6.5	i had the a1c done twice because i work for a hospital and they were having health fares and both times it was around 6.5 but they didn't follow up from there and my insurance wasn't active yet so i just had to wait until i could get into see a doctor	1
7.5	surgeons will not consider you a candidate for procedure unless your a1c is 7.5 or lower, so i started to see a local diabetic specialist at the medical center, in jan	1
7.1	i have my surgical consult tomorrow, so i had an a1c done this afternoon, the nurse asked me what i thought my numbers would be and i figured 7.1	1
14.1	a  n a1c of 14.1 is extremely high and still needs a lot of work, but if that is an improvement from the last check the congrats	1
5	according to new values the medical community now want a1c to be as close as 5 as they can get	1
-	a1c is an average of your bgs in a 90 day period which includes all your highs and lows	1
7	yet for one of those times she had an a1c of about 7	1
5	an a1c of 5 is to low though	1
6	this is such a good explanation&hellip;my a1c is 6,my dr said he wants me to hold it here, no lower	1
7	hey lexadelly~~ i never heard where an a1c reading above 7 is high	1
10	all of my dox have told me to get my a1c down when it was a 10	1
7	i,'ve only heard of an a1c 7 or below is the best	1
8.1	my last a1c was done just a week ago, and it was at a 8.1	1
8.87	i'm stll paying doctor bills for other things withn my family you can purchase a a1c test kit at walmart for $8.87	1
0	om/health/a1c-test/my0	1
6	my a1c was 6 and my doctor said that was good, but the article placed his comment into context	1
20	14.1 might be considered awesome if the person had an a1c of 20 previously	1
5.5	my last a1c was 5.5 and i am quite pleased to learn that	1
5.8	i believe i read that 5.8 is normal and anything over is high for a1c, but i am sure anything close to 5.8 is great	1
6.7	three months ago i went for an a1c and other blood work and was astonished it was at 6.7 and having a new doctor, i wished to try diet and exercise to get it back down to pre-diabetic	1
8	however, i was shocked and scared to discover my a1c had jumped to 8	1
14	as you may know, i was diagnosed with t2 in august with an a1c of 14	1
10	i had a a1c and mine was i think a 10 or so	1
2	tml english so, today i was able to look up my results from an a1c test my md did 2 days ago	1
6.9	my a1c is 6.9	1
6.9	but most people settle on three mos&hellip;so if an a1c over a period of three mos of 6.9 does not constitute diabetes to your doctor&hellip;i think she needs to stop treating any diabetic patients&hellip;just one chicks opinion	1
-	for at least three months (the a1c test measures your bgl over the last 90 days) you have been in the "danger zone" and your doctor is willing to let you stay in that zone for three more months	1
6.5	even mayo clinic says 2 consecutive a1c above 6.5	1
10.0	i was diagnosed 8 years ago (at the age of 53) with an a1c of 10.0 and was put on metformin and told to cut out sugars and eat low carb &hellip; which i did	1
6.9	if at all possible &hellip;you look for another&hellip;the fact she called an a1c of 6.9 pre-diabetes shows me how little knowledge of the disease she actually has&hellip; i agree	1
3	has your doctor done a1c tests that determines your avg blood glucose over 3 months	1
6	))  being a type 1 for 37 years, i had resisted going on a pump until 2011&hellip;now i'm sorry i had waited so long&hellip;it's the best treatment option for me and helped me eliminate scary low bg's and get my a1c's back into the 6's	1
5.8	my latest a1c is 5.8	1
15	we already know what it does to hgb a1c levels and to weight (remember one can of soda per day for a year can result in a weight gain of 15 pounds) but now it&#39;s shown that  it may well impact the lipids that set up our patients for heart disease when they are older	1
5.5%	within about 5 mo i lost 65 lbs and lowered my a1c to 5.5%	1
10.0	i was diagnosed type 2 8 years ago with an a1c of 10.0 and elevated triglycerides	1
6	for me, a low-carb (&lt;50 total per day) high fiber diet, losing weight and lots of exercise helped lower my a1c to under 6 and cholesterol ratios are all ideal	1
7.1	right now, my hba1c is 7.1	1
3	i have an a1c test done every 3 months	1
5	i have to admit that recently i haven't been the most diligent and if i really tried i could probably get my a1c down to the low 5's	1
1	don't stop now, just think of all of the benefits that come with reducing your a1c as little as 1 point	1
-	for every 1% reduction in a1c, the risk of developing eye, kidney and nerve disease is reduced by 40%	1
13.9	i called the office on april 30 to see if the results came back abd i told them that i was getting worst, they said that my a1c test showed that it was a 13.9 and i also have type a &amp; b flu	1
12.6	but i did get some good news on friday in 2 weeks my a1c test showed that it dropped down to 12.6	1
12	im a type 1 and when my a1c was 12, they admitted me into icu as well and were very worried	1
14	i will say this tho&hellip;they will most lilly want to do labs&hellip;at least a1c and a cmp14	1
5.5	i plan to stay at a1c of 5.5 or below for the rest of my life	1
5.8	hoping to get in that a1c area on my next labs (5.8 now) already seen the cholesterol &amp; blood pressure ("ideal" according to my doctor) benefits of low carb	1
9.6	the best my a1c has ever been was 9.6	1
5.7	my last a1c was 5.7 and my endocrinologist is concerned that i may be having lows i am unaware of	1

1	my a1c1 was staying hi	1
16	i need to be in full control&hellip;so i am sure i will do it&hellip;i am having my first a1c test on january 16th	1
1	back in the early 2000's, my a1c kept creeping up and my pcp (who was treating my diabetes at the time) prescribed avandia (even though i was a type 1 and on insulin)	1
5.4	some days my bg goes crazy just because&hellip;  my a1c  last month was 5.4 so i must be doing something right	1
1	i too can always guess what a1c will be, i have my a1c once a year, had it twice the first year, was such a good number that i do it less often now, because i stick to diet and exercise and testing	1
6.3	i should have the a1c tests back next week&hellip;if its lower than 6.3 i can realize my dream of becoming a mother	1
1	although at first glance a 5.7 a1c is good, if you are dropping low frequently and bounce high frequently then it's actually worse than having a higher a1c	1
6.9	high morning sugar help any suggestion by hba1c is 6.9	1
6	tml english my doc left me a message today saying i was prediabetic and that all i had to do was diet/exercise and repeat a1c in 6 months&hellip; im terrified	1

7.3	my a1c did come down to 7.3 though and the nurse practitioner was pleased	1
7.8	i was surprised to hear that my a1c was 7.8	1
6.5	two weeks ago i had an a1c with results of 6.5	1
9.5	:o)   tony5657 in new braunfels, tx a year ago i was pre-diagnosed, bs 250 and a1c 9.5, with this condition and was told to exercise and diet	1
5.4	my last visit i was told it was excelent keeping bs between 100 and 110 and my a1c was 5.4, but the testing was done to keep a check on my sugar	1
6.5	a1c of 6.5 says you are a the lowest end of the scale of what defines diabetes	1
7	a1c of 7 or below is recommended for diabetics so there is no need at this point to worry about damage being done to your body	1
7	if the reading is more than 180, you need to get on meds;  if it's less than 180, your a1c will stay below 7 which is fine	1
6.5	hi yes your doctor was wrong (sorry); an a1c of 6.5 defines diabetes	1
6.5	my last a1c was 6.5	1
5	if you are not taking meds (and it sounds like you are not), then i would be willing to bet if you cut back on carbs (in the form of bread, potatoes, pasta, and refined sugar) and focus on lean proteins, a few servings of fresh fruit a day, some lowfat dairy and lots of veggies, and if you modify your life to include at least 30 minutes of cardio activity a day, you will most likely be able to get your a1c down to 5 or below without further intervention	1
6.6	regarding your a1c of reading of 6.6, it kinda depends on where you had been, and where you want to be	1
1	what had your a1c been when you were 1st dx'd	1
6.2	in my case, 6.6 would be horrible because my last a1c had been 6.2, and i would be going the wrong way	1
1	note: if you are anemic your a1c will read much lower than your actual blood sugars and the resulting a1c is not a useful gauge of your actual blood sugar control	1
4.6%	hp    heart attack risk rises in a straight line fashion as a1c rises from 4.6%	1
7.4	my blood sugars run between 120 and 60 but my a1c is 7.4	1
1	i also find it interesting that a1c is discussed as to where the numbers should be and then put out that a1c isn't an accurate measurement for individuals	1
14.1	feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1	1
8.4	my intitial a1c was 8.4	1

10.9	was he talking about your a1c being 10.9	1
6	bg was 115 and my a1c was a 6	1
3	:)   good luck &amp; hugs to lower my triglycerides i lower my carbs to  about 40 a day it worked for me :) the hba1c test stands for glycohemoglobin and it gives you an average of your blood glucose levels over the past 3 months (like jim said	1
3	i have no idea what they mean, but you a1c score is a 3 month snap shot of your blood sugar levels	1
5.2	it's done the job as my last a1c was 5.2	1
5.6	by the way, my a1c was 5.6 (surprisingly	1
6.2	i am working on lowering my a1c, last was 6.2	1
5.5	i am hesitant to tell my doctor though until i have managed to bring my a1c to about 5.5 i so totally agree with you	1
0.4	i used one before i had a doctor and when i had my a1c from the lab it was only a 0.4 difference	1
3	my endo requests an hba1c blood test every 3 months	1
3	your a1c gives you an average of what your glucose levels are over approximately 3 months	1
1	to find out what your current a1c is and also ask him what he would like your a1c to be	1
1	your a1c is important because it gives you a true picture of how well you are controlling your levels over a period of time, not just for 1 day	1
1	cat:  ask your doctor what your a1c levels were while hospitalized and how often he/she wants you to be checked for a1c	1
5.9	my a1c has been less than 5.9	1
5.7	still in control of my bs, no change in my a1c either, still 5.7	1
7%	my a1c is 7%, so my diabetes is not that out of control that i should be having these severe symptoms	1
5.2	blood work was back and my fasting level was 97; triglycerides down 50 pts and a1c 5.2	1
5.2	great job like those numbers my last a1c was 5.2 also weight was down cholesterol numbers were good	1
3	my doctor has an a1c done every 3 months	1
2	they took blood to test my a1c and 2 other things (don't remember what)	1
6.2	my a1c was down to 6.2 (yippee) but everything else so normal	1
5.7	a1c is 5.7 but he tells me i'm not doing it right	1
6.5	i still put in 8-hour days on my feet, exercise regularly in the form of farm work, take care of my feet as the army taught me to and do whatever i have to to keep that a1c down below 6.5	1
6	i received a lot of help and support when i first came on in march, support that helped me get my d under control and drop from a 10.9 to a 5.7 a1c in 6 months	1
1	my son that's 4 was diagnosed with type 1b about 3 months ago he was put on insulin at first but taking off shortly because he kept running too low when we started out he had a yeast infection and an infection in his finger because he sucks on his fingers he is also epileptic and takes keppra for that when we went into the doctor for the infection i told him that he was peeing a lot and he always wanted something to drink it was the start of summer vacation so i thought it was just because he was outside all the time and its hot and i remember that he was also getting more sweets and drinking milk and eating a lot more ice cream he really didn't do too much dairy before this summer so the doctor check for ketones and he had ketone he then checked his sugar it was at 230 they sent us to the hospital to get blood work then right back to the doctors office they put him on insulin and said that his a1c was 11 we done that for a few days we went back to see the doctor and we decided that we wanted to go to cincinnati children's there's a recheck is a 1 c it was still 11 we were there for 4 days learning how to do everything got more blood work done went back about a week and a half two weeks later his a1c was down 8.6 and they noticed that his sugar was still going low after taking him off his long lasting and putting him way down on his after meal so they ended up taking him completely off he has been off of insulin for about 2 months now his blood sugars run great his morning fasting is anywhere from 65 to 85 thes after meals are always back to normal by 3 hours he just went back to the doctor just last week and his a1c was down to 6.7 and they done a peptide and the doctor said he was normal his fasting was 81 his c peptide was 0.4 and his insulin was 1.1 i'm not really sure how that's read but she said  please somebody help me understand this stuff does sound strange	2

4.1	if my a1c was 4.1 then i would test my bg no less than once every two hours to prevent a severe low	1

10.1	i went to the doctor last week and my a1c was a 10.1 and i was feeling fine but my doctor put me on another med and said if it does not bring my blood sugar down i will have to take insulin but before then i started to make a change in my life by not drinking sodas and that include the diet ones	1
-	my a1c was 230	1
7	have tried soooo hard to eat right,test enough times a day,take my insulin as perscribed but yet since my numbers aren't in the low 70's and my a1c is only 7	1
5.5%	since i have started the "experiment" 3 + yrs ago, i was able to get off my twice daily injections of nph (i know not possible for t 1s but you could likely reduce the amount taken), and lost 65 lbs over the course of 5 mo all the while maintaining my bg (blood glucose) levels at 80 to 130 mg/dl and achieved an a1c of 5.5%	1
-	my doc has not put me on any meds for my pre diabetes, wonder why if my bg is this high and my a1c was 129	1
5.4	i have lost 15 pds and my sugars are stable and my a1c is down to 5.4	1
6.3	i hate having to measure or count :( so that's why i cut everything i loved out&hellip;and at my last 3 month blood work my a1c is 6.3	1
7.2	my a1c was 7.2 and that is acceptable but i am working like you to get my numbers down	1
5.5	i also had maintained a bg (blood glucose) level in the 80 to 130 mg/dl range and achieved an a1c of 5.5	1
4.1	i'm on metformin once daily, now my bg runs less than 100 and my a1c is  4.1	1
-	a1c testing was not available until 1976	1
-	my doc started a1c's with his patients in 1980	1
6.5	i've had it for 21 years and had my lowest a1c of 6.5 last month	1
5	andrea, i worked several years to reduce my a1c to the 5's	1
6.6	still, my bg is all over the place, yet a1c is down to 6.6	1
8.0	hello and welcome see what you doc has to say but with an a1c of 8.0 you may need more then just diet  you may not need then if you can cut the carbs way back  each of us are different  best wishes h	1
14.1	feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1	1
1	"   well i looked to find an a1c to blood glucose (bg) chart and i found an application which will tell you what the average bg level will be with a particular a1c	1
6.1	my last a1c was 6.1	1
5.6	my a1c now after being on the pump is now down to 5.6	1
1.6	a1c decreased 1.6 which really made my day	1
5.4	hoping my hga1c drops some although technically it is good at 5.4 i'm curious how you are doing with the bydureon	1
4	my a1c went up .4 and no weight loss so the dr gave me a choice of staying with it or switching back	1
4	i thought 6.0 was the norm for a1c readings and ur at .4	1
5.4	i don't go back to endo until july for recheck, but my a1c started at 5.4	1
3	a1c is an average of every 3 months	1
6	keeping your a1c in the mid "6s" is the best	1
9.99	they do sell a a1c test at walmart for 9.99 i believe	1
5.9	(this is up from 11) your hemoglobin a1c was much improved at 5.9	1
8	my last a1c was around 8	1
7.5%	i am very happy to say that since my last visit in august with my endo i have further brought my a1c to 7.5% and managed to get my hdl and ldl all within normal limits	1
12	which if that was an average for me that would have put my a1c at over 12	1
9.8	my apt with the dr was a few weeks ago my a1c was very high at 9.8	1
7	i told my doctor that my goal is an  a1c of around 7	1
7	so he went along with my a1c of 7 even though he didn't agree with me	1
8	now the new research says that those 70 or 75 forgot which,  should shoot for an a1c of 8	1
5.5	i lost 65 lbs over 5 mo, kept my bg level at 80 to 130 mg/dl, achieved an a1c of 5.5	1

6.6	my last a1c was 6.6	1
3	my hba1c was extremely high for at least 3 years and speaking form my families persective i was like a completely different person	1
7%	how come then that so many diabetics don't have their a1c under 7%	1
7	some say an a1c below 7 is a good goal and will cut the odds of complications substantially	1
6.0	most professionals that i have talked with seem to feel that in many situations, it would be highly unlikely for a pwd to get the proper nutrition and achieve an a1c equivalent of a person without diabetes or even below 6.0	1
5.4	the reason i wasn't happy with was because 5 yrs ago i was tested due to having polycyctic ovarian syndrome and even with fastings in upper 70-low 80 and a1c of 5.4, i failed the glucose tolerance test twice	1
5.6	a person with a very desirable low a1c of, lets say, 5.6 is doing the happy dance	1
6.0	an a1c below 6.0 would be normal range	1
6.0	also, do you think it is reasonably possible to get all the necessary nutrition, if a pwd aims for an a1c of less than 6.0	1
6	my a1c has never been below 6	1
5.3	i pray you get to feeling much better soon   james my last a1c was 5.3, so i think i am ok on the diet angle	1

9.5	she was just at the doctor and her a1c was 9.5, yes she is rebelling and does not like doing what she is supposed to when it comes to taking control of her health equating her anger solely, exclusively with her blood sugar though "understandable" (from narrow perspectives), is a serious mistake	1
6.4	6.4 is good and the other test will tell if u r a diabetic or not so do not worry about the 6.4 it just states that ur bg has been good for the last three months a1c is not a home run test for diagnosis however 6.4 shows you have a problem	1

5.5	for my blood work at time of my test my 12 hour fasting bg was 63 and my a1c was 5.5	1
1	thank you congradulations on your low a1c, grainboy1	1
5.4	my last a1c was 5.4, trying to get it lower than that	1
8	fast forward to the end of september, 2015 lab work: my fasting bg had dropped to 114, and a1c to 8, all in just one month	1
6	this translates to an a1c of below 6 for the nearly two months that i've been self-monitoring	1
6.5	i was what you might call pre-diabetic for years&hellip;my doctor was forver warning me about it, and monitoring it&hellip;i'd see her, and my fbg would be like 110 and a1c of like 6.5 - and so i just decided my doctor was being an alarmist and no big deal, right	1
-	i'd maintain that the 6.5 a1c and the 110 fasting bgl were your ticket to our club &hellip; a you just decided not to join us then :( don't place too much "weight" on a single reading &hellip; particulary as a new member of the club &hellip; there are many factors that can raise bgl besides your last meal	1
5.7	it wasn't until after my stroke and i got extremely serious about staying alive and got a doctor willing to listen to my research and theories that i got my health where i felt it should be &hellip; ideal body weight, 15% body fat, ideal cholesterol ratios, normal blood pressure and an a1c of 5.7	1

2	good job :-) very nice&hellip;that is some dip in a1c lady&hellip;you should be proud&hellip;and i am very glad your doctor wants to use your experience to help other people&hellip;i have come to the conclusion that the only way to change the way type 2 is dealt with by doctors is for people such as yourself to be vocal advocates of the lifestyle they follow&hellip;i make it a point whenever a med student is around ( i go to lsu clinic which is part of a teaching hospital) to tell my doctor (knowing the medical students are observing)	1

2	i heard from my doctor today and she said i am due for my next a1c in 2 weeks	1
1	its like everything else everyday on the news some "expert" is always informing us everything that is bad to eat or it can cause this or that well i have found that moderation is the key for those of you with type 1 follow your doctor's advice to the letter for my condition which is type 2 weight control and exercise along with proper portions of any foods seem not to wreak havoc with my numbers sure i have a spike after eating regardless of what i eat but i feel the key is that this spike quickly recedes due to exercise and weight control in otherwords as long as this spike does not stay high for extended periods of time simple walking, 2-3 miles a day works wonders i have been practicing this method for over a year now and my a1c numbers have been vastly improved i am not saying that it is alright to eat eggs everyday or anything for that matter in excessive amounts remember you can eat large amounts of carrots each day and gain weight and we all know and are aware of what excessive weight does for a type 2 diabetic sure if you have a piece of cake everyday or candy i guarantee you will experience adverse effects & have a poor a1c number but if you exercise and control your weight you more than likely can indulge once in a while depending on how severe your diabetes is how one should determine the path to follow remember everyone is different and reacts accordingly if very severe, yes you must stay completely away from bad foods until it is definetly in control if you have what i have, type 2 (insulin therapy) (insulin as needed) and control my daily number moderation and portions is the path i follow i found along with my doctor that oral meds were not as effective so thus the insulin therapy my a1c number was 11% and is now 6% losing 1-2 pounds per week can be acheived relatively easy without the heavy stress i was able to lose 30lbs and wow what a difference in my daily numbers and that was acheived with portion control along with walking but it does come to a point whereas the exercise portion of any program must be increased as once you reach a stablized plateau weightwise it gets harder to lose additional weight without increase in activity you may be eating properly but you will find that is not enough i eat egg whites mo of thste time	2
8	my bs readings are good and my a1c came down 8 points eating my eggs	1
2	metformin did a lot to keep my blood glucose in order during a 2-year study i did with the university of minnesota comparing gastric bypass surgery with intensive medical treatment to lower a1c's in t2 diabetics	1
6.6	i'm type 2,  and tho my numbers really fluctuate, my newest a1c is 6.6 but cholesterol is high	1
7	this is a great question, and the good news is that keeping a1c under 7 and overall good diabetes management helps prevent these complications	1
8.9%	my a1c was at a 8.9% and i was on nuvaring birth control at the time	1
6	35442-a1c-below-6	1

6	i've always aimed for bg's between 80-180, and that results an a1c for me in the 6's	1
5.1	i was diagnosed last year and through diet and exercise i am able to keep my a1c at 5.1	1
5.5	i have had great success with my meal plan, and had achieved an a1c of 5.5 and pretty well normalized my blood glucose (bg) readings	1

6.9	works great&hellip;last a1c, 6.9 good for you hope all works out	1
6.7	my a1c is 6.7 which is low enough (my doc tells me)	1
6	i don't think that a1c under 6 caused the deaths	1
6	in my view the low a1c numbers, below 6  in the accord trials did not cause the deaths as you say	1
6	then they were drugged down to a a1c below  6	1
7	the goal is to have a1c below 7	1
10.8	i'm currently at 7.4, the a1c before this was 10.8, so i'm improving	1
22	here our test strips show the same numbers as the a1c tests do in the states, but you have to multiply that number by 22 to get the reading in the states	1
6	y readings have always been good, and my a1c is below 6	1
5	great job on the a1c and the 5 mile walks	1
14.1	bet you thought you were a walking time bomb with that a1c of 14.1	1

6.9	i have lost over 100 lbs and my last a1c was 6.9	1
3	you have to remember that an a1c is a test that dr's use to get an average of your bloodsugars have been for the last 3 months	1
3	a1c is a 3 month check of your blood sugar	1
7	for the loooooongest time my a1c was always right around 7 (sometimes a little bit over) but in time it did start to drop	1
5.6	i have had my last 2 a1c results at 5.6	1
2	my doctor ordered my next a1c  to be done in 2 weeks, so i will save the home test for later	1

1	of course i am a type 1, so i am not really sure if type 2 folk get a1c readings the same as type 1 folk	1
6	the main goal is to get your a1c in the 6's&hellip;no higher	1

-	i'd like to have a1cs as low as yours, so i may try a 100 carb/day diet for awhile if need be after this next dr	1
3	while the a1c gives an overall average of your blood sugar levels for the previous 3 months, it's not a mathematical average of the blood sugar tests you do	1
8.7	i asked her to check my a1c today and the good news it has not gone up since the last time, but the bad news is it's 8.7	1

5.8	i hope no one thinks i am bragging, but i went to my doctor appointment today, and he was quite pleased that my a1c on my last test a week ago was 5.8	1

9.5	y a1c's are 9.5&hellip;god knows i try to eat right&hellip;i know i should get to the gym, but i hurt and have no ambition	1

16	i am hoping to see similar improvement, although at an a1c of 16, i think anything would be an improvement	1
4.5	not sure i am able to piece the situation together from the various posts&mdash;are you saying that you consistently get high blood sugar readings after meals, but your a1c is around 4.5	1
1	there are two possible causes for this situation that i can think of:  first, you are getting a higher reading then what your actual blood sugar is (this could occur if you draw blood from a site contaminated with sugars); second, your a1c is lower then your true blood sugar&mdash;i know i personally take quite a bit of alpha lipoic acid (with biotin added) which does cause the a1c to be lower then without taking it	1

15.8	it eventually did and the doctor said that my a1c was 15.8	1

14.1	gary hi blade i have struggled with diabetes for a long time now i am now getting complications toe that hasn't healed over a year neuropathy pain very bad try to watch your diet now so you don't have complications i finally found a dietician who takes my insurance my bs has gone down my toe is starting to heal it is amazing what food combinations do to your bs you should try to see a dietician i tip she taught me was to have a yogurt or 1 cup of skim milk before you go to sleep it helps with your bs during the night good luck feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1	1
7.9	i was 100 lbs overweight with blood sugars between 170's to 200, high cholesterol, a1c of 7.9	1
6	while an a1c every 6 months is ok, the standard deviation is a large part of how complications develop or don't develop	1
5.9	i had several lows and got the shakes real bad one time when i had a " perfect" a1c of 5.9&mdash;&mdash;yet, the doctor i saw then just looked at that number only, said everything was perfect&hellip;it wasn't&hellip;good luck	1
14.5%	my a1c was 14.5% and i didn't even realize how terrible i felt all the time	1
14	then the result for the h1a1c would come back sky high around 14	1
6.1	she did so based on my blood sugar test of 138, with an a1c of 6.1	1
7.0%	in my future posts, i may answer one question per post, to break it up a bit:) howdy flutter i hate to disagree with your pcp (even though i disagree with drs all the time) but according to your a1c of 7.0% is definitely diabetes according to the ada	1
6.5%	"a1c &gt; 6.5%	1
7.0	the "a1c below 7.0 is normal" was a webmd figure	1
6.1	my a1c is 6.1	1

6.2	i'm not in denial-i know i have diabetes-my a1c was 6.2 a couple months ago-so not bad, but i really just don't care, and seems like nobody else does either	1

7.7	we talked about different things he ws going to put me on, my a1c came back 7.7 and in aug	1
9	my doctor just started me on actos this week (15mg) to reduce my blood sugar level as my last a1c was over 9	1
5.8	my lab report showed: cholesterol-126, hdl-60, ldl-52, trig-69, a1c-5.8	1

10	last time my doctor checked my a1c it was over 10 i go in on friday to get it checked again	1
6.0	i continue to be off all diabetes drugs and my a1c was 6.0 only last week	1

5.9	i had my second a1c check in april and it was at 5.9	1
-	a1c 5.7 = glucose 117 a1c 5.3 = glucose 105 i think you will find that if your bg 3 month average's are 117 your a1c is 5.7 and so on	2
14.1	feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1	1
5.8	i lost 20lbs&hellip; a1c went to 5.8 and my liver lipids are in range	1
6	it was the best thing that could of happened to me, my a1c is a 6, i could now just take metformin pills but i figure if i am doing so good w/ insulin why get off	1
6.5	my a1c is and has been around 6.5 for three years and not on any meds for it	1

-	i'm a vegan, i eat no carbs, no fruit, nothing "illegal", but not only is my a1c extremely high, my bs when i wake up is over 600	1
16	if your a1c is 16, then your blood sugars are not just hitting peaks but are high overall	1
3	an a1c level test is a 3 month average so the initial diagnosis of diabetes really isn't the best time to give an average of glucose levels	1
3	a hemoglobin a1c measures your bg over a 3 month period of time; in a percentage	1
9.6	my a1c was 9.6 and the doc said i was killing my self	1
9	my a1c has been above 9 for over a year	1
1	ilearned how to find my average blood sugar  on my breeze meter  i have more to learn  i would like to know if my average will match what my next a1c  will show, if it is acurate it will be very usefull to me as i do not have a home a1c  tester l well l, your meter will only average the readings you have taken	1
7	if you feel that an a1c below a 7 is keeping you too low, tell your doctor	1
7.2	tml english i went for my diabetes check today and my a1c was 7.2	1
7.5	jibber jabber, my a1c has been 7.5 or so for many years	1
7	the major fight has to be to get you a1c below 7&hellip;the easiest way to do that is atkins	1
5.5	my may  a1c was 5.5	1
4.8	my a1c was really low, 4.8 and had dropped a lot - because it was normal for awhiles	1
6	i know if i increase my exercise level, i could get my hba1c into the mid to low 6's	1
11%	since my a1c last week at 11%+ and a not-so-good discussion with my endocrinologist,  i've hit the glucose meter hard and completely rearranged my schedule	1
6.5	my a1c has been under 6.5 while on januvia	1
6%	works like a charm for me, with an hba1c in the low 6% range and no hypos at all	1
5.5	when i managed my t2d by my meal plan alone, i regularly had a1c levels of 5.5	1
7.1	last a1c was 7.1, so i find it absolutely essential	1

6.9	(although an a1c of 6.9 is on the high end of diabetics in good control and not so very bad	1
6.3	(a1c was then 6.3) thank you again for taking the time to respond and i will continue to learn all that i can and pray for healthier lives for all of us	1
6.3	even with keeping an a1c of 6.3 i have gastroporesis (so eating is not easy) and nerve damage in my foot (walking is very painful)	1

18	kind of depressing too, just brought my a1c to the lowest its been since i was diagnosed 18years ago and now its all over the place	1
5.4	visit i had a a1c of 5.4	1
5.3	it was also traced to attribute to the severe allergies, and then in oct 08 they said her pancreas was also being affected but a1c came back normal 5.3	1

5.7	lower my a1c to &lt; 5.7  and to be more compassionate and strive for more serenity	1
5.5	get my a1c down to 5.5 if possible	1
3	tfckmk988 just to expand in case some of you were wondering this was my a1c after 3 months from being diagnosed as edited in my reply below i meant to say, try putting up a picture of yourself up on your wall, of when you were at your ideal weight or a weight you want to get back to	1
5.9	i got my a1c down to 5.9 and have managed to stop my neuropathy from progressing&hellip;for now at least :)	1
6.0	i have lost almost 30lbs, gotten my a1c number down to 6.0 and my endo is very happy	1
13.7	from my one and only a1c of 13.7, i had diabetes for months before i was diagnosed	1
6.4	my a1c was 6.4	1
7	my a1c has ben 7 for years and years	1
5.8	my hba1c is down to 5.8 which is exactly where i want it to be	1
5.8	39 lbs down &amp; a1c of 5.8	1
5.3	when i was first diagnosed i was hitting 160 -180 about 2 hrs after eating but after 5 months on a pretty strict low carb diet i am now close to the normal range with an a1c of 5.3	1
6.6	my last hba1c was 6.6	1
5.4	brought my a1c down to 5.4	1
7	was thinking i could get my a1c in the 7 percentile range unrealistic	1
3	howdy coleman welcome to dc that is fantasic that your a1c dropped that much in 3 mo	1
6	i understand that as a type 1 the lowest a1c you can achieve is somewhere in the 6s	1
6	since starting on an insulin pump nearly 3 years ago, i've gotten my a1c back into the 6's and eliminated the really scary low bg's	1
6.8	last april my a1c was 6.8 and i'm hoping for a better one this month&hellip;awaiting lab results	1
5.5	i lost 65 lbs in 5 mo, managed my t2 without diabetes medication (generally no more than 130 mg/dl fasting bg) and achieved an a1c of 5.5	1
1	i think the 130 in relation to the a1c is speaking about the new charts that have been put out that give you a range of meter readings that indicate about what you can expect for your a1c number to be	1
14	my a1c was 14	1
8.5	when i was first diagnosed, i had three fasting glucose readings greater than 120&hellip;my a1c was 8.5	1
5.6	my a1c was only 5.6 at that time, yet my numbers on the test were indicative of diabetes	1
5.4	another problem with it is a low a1c (like 5.4) could be incredibly dangerous if a lot of low blood sugars contributed to it	1
6.5	the a1c has never been used for diagnosis and it's only been this year that some criteria has been put around it so it can be used for diagnosis and that was 6.5+ is diabetes	1
5	after all those years, i realized the problem was that i was too aggressive in trying to maintain a low a1c&hellip;aiming for the 5's	1
6	aim for a slightly higher a1c&mdash;being in the 6's is good enough	1
5.6	my publicly stated goal is to achieve an a1c of 5.6 or less, i am not worried about the lipid panel or any of the other tests	1
5	let us now if u did it good luck steve trying not to be over confident &hellip; the 30 day average on my meter is 107 &hellip; been on this merry-go-round long enough to know that means very little i use to try for an a1c in the 5's, but ended up with too many hypoglycemic reactions	1
5.8	three months ago my a1c was 5.8	1
2	i understand how you feel i will have my first a1c test since finding out  i have t2 next monday and i am nervous but excited too	1
7	i cannot wait till my a1c comes back next week to see if i can give up the insulin and stick with pills,  doctor said if it was 7 or below i could go off and see if the pills will work as well	1
6.0	i've maintained an a1c of 6.0 with variations occasionally of  two tenths of a point	1
6.0	i do question the idea of a person with diabetes that maintains an a1c much below 6.0	1
6.0	a person without diabetes, that eats a nutritionally balanced food plan will accomplish an a1c well below 6.0 naturally	1
6.0	to maintain an a1c much below 6.0, i strongly suspect a diabetic would most likely be ingesting an insufficient amount of carbs, or taking an abundant amount of medication	1
6.1	a1c was 6.1	1
2	i have noticed if any doctor i have tried so far sees a low a1c at all, they focus completely on that, then all of a sudden they hand me the bill, kind of shrug, then they say they have to get going&hellip;the long acting insulin i had in the emergency room cleared up my vision , stabilized me really really good&hellip;any doctor i have seen prior to this last one said " i don't want to see the record of what the hospital gave you, because a hospital cannot diagnose&hellip;" or, they say " well, you've gotten by this long without insulin again&hellip;2 years, so, you'll be fine&hellip;"  then, again, they leave&hellip;well, i will just stay focused on this last doctor&mdash;-time will work everything out, i am positive it will, what i meant to say is that god will keep staying with me&hellip;i credit him for everything that is good&hellip;and i remind myself that it's not god's fault if some doctors are hurtful	1
9.8	bg's are running around 225 today (fasting 238, after bkfst 226) my most recent a1c was 9.8	1
6.8	my last a1c was 6.8 and i expect the next one in august to be lower	1
2	well, it really helped very much and over the past 4 months, my a1c has dropped 2 whole points without me doing anything different other than taking this pill	1
12	my a1c at the time was 12	1
6.0	it's a glucose monitor it's awesome and no you need a prescription, but it's awesome it's brought my a1c to a 6.0 and warns me when my sugar is falling or rising and it's a neat lil thing and i don't have to check my sugar as many times a day	1
6.6	and my last a1c was 6.6	1
6.5	2 hour glucose fasting test showed an average of 140 bg over the past 3 months, and an a1c of 6.5	1
5.7	an a1c of 5.7 isn't high enough to really consider diabetes, what was your glucose level when it was tested, fasting and not	1
2	another thing, just because your a1c is "normal" does not mean you do not have prediabetes of t2	1
3	you can have highs which are balanced out with lows, since the a1c is an average of your bg#s over 3 months	1
6.5	yet her a1c  would be in the 6.5 range	1
3	i get an a1c every 3 months and meet with my doctor for the results	1
10.3	my a1c is horrible - 10.3	1
7	the lowest my blood sugar ever has been a1c of 7	1
2	i have my 1st follow up a1c and fear this last 2 weeks will mess it up&hellip;color me puzzled and worried	1
5.4	there is snowball chance in hell that i am "non diabetic" just because my a1c dropped to 5.4	1
15	i am so glad to find someone else who has these issues too (not glad we have them, but you know what i mean :) i was taking huge bolus doses of levamir xl every morning and every night and novolog in between, and my a1c was still 15	1
11.6	my a1c is back up to 11.6 (oof, i know	1
6.6	(i am not nearly as active as you and considerably older:  i allow myself 120 grams of carb per day and my last a1c was 6.6	1
5.5	in that time i've have had an a1c of 5.5	1
1	read my discussion titled "you have to be your own analyst" it may help you gain control and reduce your a1c1 and blood sugar levels	1
6	fasting and before meals blood sugar should be between 80-110 and your a1c should be 6 or under	1
6.7	my last a1c was 6.7 in december	1
12	my a1c is 12 which is insane	1
7	not to mention a1c below 7 how can that be	1
5.4	and my a1c went to 5.4, she told me i had "mild" diabetes	1
5.6	i also do not think looking back that she should have ever put me on pills to start with when my a1c was 5.6	1
5.4	and my a1c went to 5.4, she told me i had "mild" diabetes	1
5.6	i also do not think looking back that she should have ever put me on pills to start with when my a1c was 5.6	1
7.1	i already have the feeling my a1c is not below 7.1	1
7	i'm hoping for a below 7 a1c but i think it might be higher than 7	1
5.5	i currently test my blood glucose 12-15 times per day to keep my a1c below 5.5	1
13	my last a1c was 13+	1
6	my average a1c is 6	1
5.0	if caught in the very beginning&hellip;to nourish the body and spank your beta cells back to life (grin)&hellip;i know my insulin sensitivity has improved a great deal&hellip;my a1c is 5.0 and i no longer take meds	1
1	there are many things that affect your a1c reading and you should be aware if you have many lows or if you donate blood, this can lower your a1c	1
2	my a1c has been more or less the same for the past 2 years so i'm not convinced that constantly checking makes much difference &hellip; other than occasionally causing a bit of stress	1
5.8	(btw &hellip; i am type 2 on metformin only and fairly well controlled with an a1c of 5.8) there is some research that seems to support not testing:  http://bit	1
3	honestly i don't see the purpose of testing your own a1c as it's an average of 3 months	1
1	i am aware of those a1c machines, but for the rest of the a1c done through the dr office was done with phlebetomist and sent off in a vial	1
4.7	my readings are such that i got an a1c of 4.7   i do not think the metformin has a lot to do with it&hellip;it is the diet/exercise changes in my opinion	1
6.0	very scary, i don't know how many glucose tabs i ate, but it was a bunch    i am now the proud owner of a glucagon emergency kit and i will not hesitate to use if i get below 50 again   with the results of my blood showing my a1c being 6.0 last week my hcp agreed with me it might be a time to cut back on my insulin dosage it's good that your staying on top of the situation	1
6.8	but i have things back in order with a a1c of 6.8 my lowest ever at my last appointment	1
9.6	but, when my a1c hit 9.6 i knew i had to try something else	1
3	karyn dear melissa, your a1c is an average of your bg readings over the past 3 months	1
3.3	she kept taking her insulin on an empty stomach, and she drove her a1c down to 3.3	1
5	tml english i don't know what i'm doing wrong but my blood sugars has been fine but my a1c was 5 last month	1
6	the deterioration is not reversible, so you need to get your a1c in the 6's immediately if not sooner	1
9.8	beating my a1c of 9.8 is not good	1
11.3	my a1c is 11.3 after this i havent seen a doctor just because of the whole insurance stuff	1
9.3	my doc pretty much said heres ur pills and sent me on my way my a1c was 9.3 so i know that s not really high but high	1
10.3	i know i have to exdersie i weigh 276 ilbs but im so tired all the time and if i could id sleep all day please help hi,  when i first got diabetes,  my eyes went blurry &amp; my a1c was 10.3	1
7.1	my bs was 134 and my a1c was 7.1	1
6.3%	my a1c has been 6.3%, but i constantly feel drained	1
5.9	lol i'm proud to say my last reading on my a1c was 5.9	1
4	lol i would like to get my a1c in to the 4's	1
1	with the 7.6 a1c, it sounds like your body is not metabolizing all the food you eat, resulting in higher than desired bg's and a higher a1c	1
7.6	my a1c is 7.6	1
1	i don't know what my a1c was, as i wasn't aware that there was a thing as an a1c reading	1
-	getting an a1c will tell you your average blood sugar these past 30 days	1
6	my solution is to test often, understand what i'm eating, and take it from there&hellip;the goal is to achieve an a1c in the 6's	1
6	moe i respectfully disagree with your statement "how you get there doesn't matter" in regards to getting your a1c in the 6s	1
12	i still use mdi(syringes) using novalog and levimire insulins and am able to ave 5.8% a1c's this past 12 mo ave period	1
5.6	my a1c was only 5.6 (my cholesterol numbers weren't good and they all needed to improve which they did later) i am doing really well, but i sure have not reversed it yet	1
5.4	my last a1c, which was over a year ago (i need to have it done again but going to pay my doctor bill of first) was 5.4 i know my doctor said it was caught early	1
7.0	keep your a1c below 7.0, watch your diet, exercise, and keep your weight down	1
5.4	when my a1c went down to 5.4, one of the diabetic education specialists (they always phoned to go over things with me) talked as if it was in remission for a while or something, she was very impressed	1
6.5	my pcp just diagnosed me  as being  type 2 because of symptoms and a1c  at 6.5 (i think, cant remember)	1
5.5	that is a blood sugar that stays within 70 to 110 at all times and an a1c below 5.5	1
5.9	i got serious about my control and have gotten my a1c down to 5.9 over the past couple of years	1
6.6	in april my a1c came back 6.6&hellip;i	1
3	i would also like to point out that our daughter's first a1c test was normal, however as the disease had only begun there wasn't 3 months of data from her system available	1
6	i hope your a1c is 6	1
6	my a1c is 6 and the dr and i are very happy	1
7	a little high in sugars / carbs but i haven't had an a1c above 7 in about ten years so i figure i'm doing ok	1
5.7	i have been following this basic pattern (intermittent fasting) for about 6 months and my a1c last week was 5.7 (lowest since diagnosis) and have been taken off metformin	1
5.3	some good news came to me recently though that i wanted to share, my a1c is now 5.3 and i feel great about it	1
6.5	my a1c is 6.5	1
14.1	feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1	1
7.5	my last a1c was 7.5 and the doctor told me he doubted if i even had diabetes due to all my asthma meds	1
6.4	i can't get my a1c below 6.4 lately	1
10.8%	i started carb counting at the beginning of the year due to my december a1c being 10.8% and it had improved my numbers so much	1
7.5%	monday i had an a1c done it is now 7.5% and the only thing i changed was counting my carbs	1
6.0	my a1c's are below 6.0, so we are both happy	1
9.5	my last a1c went up to 9.5&hellip; hey allison - can you give us a little more info on your current regimen	1
6.0	my a1c has hovered around 6.0 ever since i was diagnosed, without exaggeration	1
6.0	i know many are shooting for a lower a1c, then 6.0	1
6.4	it does take time to get things under comtrol, but after 2 mos of diet and insulin my numbers were already dropping and in dec my a1c was at 6.4	1
0	om/health/a1c-test/my0	1
5.5	diet, a few supplements, quitting alcohol, exercise, acupuncture, meditation, stress reduction, some the usual suspects, have brought me to an hba1c today of 5.5	1
5.9	hope this is helpful, lin hey jo thats how my numbers run after meals between 120 and 150 and my docter tells me thats fine cause even with that number i have dropped my a1c to 5.9	1
7%	he takes great care of his diabetes, doesn't have a perfect a1c but what i've read it's round the 7% mark which is far from bad and he generally has the right idea about nutrition, exercise, management techniques and the physical and mental difficulties that come along with having diabetes	1
4.8	we do the best we can with what we got &hellip;   steve jibber, also how long did it take you to lower your a1c to 4.8 and what were your numbers previously	1
6.6	what i don't understand is why you are still diabetic when the threshold for diabetics is an a1c range higher than 6.6 that is what i was told by the nurse at my recent blood test results	1
4.9	and my last a1c ( a home test) was 4.9	1
7	that was because over the past 18-20 months, my a1c's had climbed into the 7's and i was experiencing scary morning lows	1
8.8	when i was diagnosed my fasting sugar was 225 and my a1c was 8.8	1
5.4	my a1c is 5.4	1
13.7	when i was diagnosed with type 1, my a1c was 13.7	1
4.9	he recently had an a1c of 4.9 and he does not have hypos	1
5.1	i feel it is healthy to have an a1c that is as low as 5.1 or even lower as long as it is not causing you to have a lot of hypos, especially ones that cause you to lose consciousness or require that you have assistance	1
6.0	it is desirable to keep your a1c below 6.0 because that is a nondiabetic level and that means it is much less likely that you may experience diabetic complications in the years ahead	1
5.1	if you are taking metformin only, an a1c of 5.1 is great, as that drug by itslf generally doesn't produce hypoglycemia	1
5.5	a1c is 5.5, and a recent ct scan of my heart reveal that i had no cholesterol plaques in my heart or aorta	1
5.5	my a1c is 5.5	1
1.5	my a1c had actually increased before this change, my dr does not believe type 1.5 exists despite me explaining that i was following the symptoms that i had been told about	1
7.5	i have been a diabetic for 20 years and have never had an a1c under 7.5	1
14.1	betty   last year i was diagnosed with fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1	1
5.9	four months later my blood sugar was down close to normal numbers and my a1c dropped to 5.9	1
6.1	y a1c is 6.1 and i am still on insulin&mdash;go figure that one	1
6.3	my last a1c was a 6.3 i believe	1
6.3	an a1c of 6.3 is fantastic	1
7	i focus on keeping an a1c of 7 or below	1
7	with an a1c of 7 or below, i can almost guarantee you , or anybody, will not lose a limb or go blind	1

13.6	tml english hi -  although diabetes runs in my dad's side of the family and i did see some side effects that were disturbing - i just put it out of my mind til that day last year when my a1c was a 13.6 and 'boom' punched in the face with the realization that i too had crossed that line	1

6.5	specifically, i went off victoza and levemir&hellip;and with diet, exercise, and metforim&hellip;i was able to maintain an a1c of 6.5	1
7	i was immediately placed on insulin after being diagnosed, i see an endocrinologist regularly, and my a1c is consistently right around 7, but that's about the extent of my diabetes life and community	1
5.9	however, not good to start insulin when my a1c is 5.9&mdash;i would not want to go unconscious if i dropped too low	1
6.9	it's worked well, although i'm still trying to get my a1c below 6.9	1
5.9	my last a1c was 5.9 which is close to non diabetic levels	1
5.1	at first he said that when they took my blood work my sugar was 268, but when the tests came back my a1c  was   5.1	1
5.1	then, they assume that my highs are rare, as in they assume i hit around 160s for highs, and that i am consistently in the 90s and 120s&mdash;&mdash;nothing could be farthest from the truth&hellip;so the next time i go in, i am showing them the wide range i have&hellip;i think it's great your a1c was 5.1&mdash;-maybe yours are more consistent than mine&hellip;that i do not know, so , didn't mean to scare you&hellip;i'm just so tired of being generically thrown in as " oh&hellip;hardly anything wrong with you	1

6.3	last month i went back to see my doc and my a1c was 6.3, my insulin is back to normal, even i take a little less now and my bs is just fine	1
6	granted, i wouldn't have to take insulin or test;  but, even this is no big deal anymore since what i do regularly results in an a1c in the 6's which is good enough	1
1	a1c the a1c test may be used to screen for and diagnose diabetes in addition to monitoring the glucose control of diabetics over time	1
7.0	so i would ask my doc about a a1c of 7.0 and do some reading on the subject lots more out there than i thought	1

12	my a1c at dx was 12	1
4.7	i went from a 13.2 a1c to 4.7 in six months on diet, exercise, and metformin	1
1	i wonder if they are doing other tests other than the a1c, because it was not required for me to fast for an a1c for quite a few years now	1
1	and no it was just a1c they told me before drawing my blood&hellip;i also asked if they needed my urine, but they said no&hellip;they did the last time&hellip;i will ask when i see my doc for my results&hellip;i really hate fasting &hellip; did they tell you what your a1c is	1

6	when i was last in to see my doctor for my a1c check it was down below 6 but the one thing i was so happy about was that my lipid panel showed that my cholesterol levels were at awesomely great levels - numbers were so much lower than i ever imagined	1
6.7	my management of it thus far (a1c 6.7) isn't enough	1

6	i am keeping my a1c in the 6 range, but i would like to improve more than that and be healthy in all aspects	1
6	gabby, i certainly agree that if you are following the basic plan to maintain your a1c in the 6's, then whatever else you do is a potential plus as you clearly describe	1

5.7	current a1c is 5.7 and bg stays pretty close to normal with the exception of breakfast (cereal, you know - but i had to eliminate eggs and breakfast meats due to cholesterol issues)	1

5.4	my a1c today was 5.4, a tad bit higher than my last one, but not significantly	1

6	i've resisted the pump, but do check often and have always managed an a1c in the 6's	1
6.1	my a1c is 6.1   robinlee oh	1
7	so now i can't control my diabetes without meds like i used too and my a1c went up to 7 for the first time	1
8	i was seeing my primary for several years recently, having a1cs checked quarterly to manage my treatment, but one visit to an endo resulted in the discovery that i was overdosing my lantus by ~8 units for the entire time i was under treatment with the primary	1

12.9	my a1c is high, at a bad 12.9 ( i know, but i'm in that denial/ busy stage in the disease, please understand) and though i wonder if this is the cause he has asked me to lose the weight, it still seems a really drastic change to me	1
6	heidi by reducing my daily carbohydrate intake, i have been able to maintain my weight around 120 pounds and keep my hba1c in the 6's	1
6	the results are steady and my a1c is 6	1
-	i have tried other meters but they were so far off on numbers i had one check up that floored me with my a1c until i realized the meter i was using was totally inaccurate by about 30 or more points every time i used it	1
6	for the most part (except for a few reading in the 7's), my a1c's have been in the 6's which indicates good diabetes control	1
7.4	my a1c when last taken was 7.4 which is down and i was patting myself on the back	1

5.9	last a1c just last week was 5.9	1
7	all the articles you reference are helpful, but i focus on exercise (treadmill) and keeping the a1c below 7	1

2	i take both basal and novolog to control my bs and finally went to the doctor last month and my a1c was down almost 2 points	1
1	since your average bg is not 24/7/90days (like an a1c would be) it could only be an estimated a1c because not all the data is included	1
7	the closest to your 145 on that chart is a 154 which averages out to a1c of 7	1
3	takes my a1c every 3 months	1

7	namaste steve although my last 3 a1c's have been in the "ideal" range, when i talked with my doctor this past week her comment to me was that i was running a bit on the lower than average side and that anything below 7 was considered "good"	1
6	i've seen my fbg slowly increasing and i do not see another a1c for 6 months	1
7.0	tml english i been testing my sugar been high 225 to 300 so just got a1c tests back it was 7.0 not what i exspected thought would be higher	1

1	i weigh 210 i am 5'6, i want to lose weight and do my best to bring down my a1c it's great that you're taking the first step by being honest with yourself about diabetes, and that you're thinking about possible changes you can make to reach your goals of weight loss and lowering your a1c	1
3	more then likely, your doctors will check your a1c which is a 3 month average of your blood glucose	1
14.1	feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1	1
6.5%	i'm trying to get my hba1c down to 6.5% so i can maybe think about having a third baby (i'm a gluten for punishment)	1

6	he wants me to get my a1c below 6	1
6.5	that diagnosis would occur once levels rose to an a1c of 6.5 percent or higher	1

13.7	tml english i'm a t2 diagnosed 4 years ago with an a1c of 13.7	1

6.0	having your a1c below 6.0 (nondiabetic level) and not having so many highs helps you avoid diabetic complications in you eyes, kidneys , heart, etc	1

7.2	my a1c is 7.2	1
5.2	but just to update you, i do not have to test anymore&hellip;i am one of the lucky ones i guess &amp; actually back to where i should be for the last 2 months with my a1c which 5.2&hellip;i may not like some of the responses i may/may not get, like we all say&hellip;what works for some may not work for others	1

5.4	my last a1c was 5.4	1
1	god bless :o) lori that's a good reason to be tested although genetics in diabetes is very complicated, especially because the different types have a completely different gene set, and a simple blood sugar and a1c test is not going to rule out type 1 forever, and maybe not even on the day it was taken	1
7.9	mine were way high 1051 and that why they told me i was headed for a stroke everything was normal except my a1c &amp; that was 7.9 plus i had a drop in bs and it scared me because my heart raced and i was sweating profusly &amp; i was shaking so badly i could bearly test my blood and felt like i couldn't stand or function	1

11.3	the first is my doctor said that my a1c was 11.3, what does this mean	1
2	sorry if this seems overwhelming but there are so many unanswered questions that the only answer i have to offer now is explaining what an a1c is, i can't begin to answer the others as i'm not your doctor but you need to be better informed on why they say your type 2 and what to do to control it, all of this should have been explained to you in much better detail then what you posted here, if it wasn't you need to contact this doctor and get the answers	1
3	to explain an a1c, it is a test that is done on the blood to give an average of what the blood glucose level has been for the past 3 months	1
2	with the a1c results you gave i understand them putting you on meds to control your diabetes but it still amazes me that they said you didn't need to test your blood glucose at home and keep a record, not going back for 2 months, you'll have no idea what your numbers are running while on the med, nor do you have a baseline of what your numbers are meter wise prior to starting the medication	1

9.4	i had a a1c of 9.4 not good whatsoever	1
3	the ha1c is a great barometer for letting you know what your blood sugars have been for the last 3 months	1

5.2	my glucose was 93 non-fasting and my hba1c was 5.2, both within normal range	1
5	i have lost a lot of weight (actually it just came off as a result of eating properly rather than "dieting" per se, i control this condition without medication and my a1c is always in the low 5's, which means i have "normal" blood sugars	1
25	abbott  freestyle neo does and there the nova max plus both these meter can test for blood ketones and i agree that one strip would be great for testing all three now would this be a meter that takes all three at the same time or would you program it for each individual test (as for ketones, i just use the strips if and when i do test) also the a1c test that i get at wallies is only $25 or so for two tests, one i do when i get my regular blood work done (and they come in pretty close) and the second is just to check where i'm at occasionally   again great idea, the convenience would be great, it's the piddly details and the fact that big pharma would design and market it that makes me go mmmmm   ~t i was thinking one strip and three buttons you would press the button for the test you want it's an interesting idea but not something i think i would use	1

7	tml english so on another diabetic forum a member posed this question   here was my response to it and thought it would be a good spark for a discussion here as well   when i was first diagnosed i got my a1c down to 7 and doc took me off of insulin gave me met   i was like you then thought hey if ada recommends 7 then thats ok , i still get that thought occasionally now, but with that 7 i let my diet go to the wayside which led to a creeping number when i last saw that doctor and then even worse i turned 26 had to wait for new insurance with work got a job which required me to be in town more and no more good timing like christmas or spring break to go to the doctor , which lead me to not see anyone for a about a year, finally did so end of march and with my recent lab work that showed a a1c of 13 and beginning signs of kidney complications i don't think i agree anymore   its a goal for the moment but not a long term one an a1c of 7 is good	2
1	both &hellip; however my chances for a normal a1c are infinitely greater than those of just being "normal" what is a good a1c number	1
5.5%	i had an a1c of 5.5% but i was in no danger of a hypo episode because  i was not using any diabetes medication to manage my numbers	1
6	i can't remember where the study he cited was conducted but a1c's lower than 6 had a higher mortality with more serious low bg episodes	1
6.5	i believe you are best served by keeping your a1c at or below 6.5 in order to avoid complications	1
7	prior to going on an insulin pump back in 2011, my hba1c had climbed into the low-mid 7's	1

6.5	i know my a1c has been in the 6.5 and i was told that they would like it to be a little higher so just be thankful that all is okay and do not let it go any higher	1
9%	if your a1c gets above 9% your doctor will likely be very concerned and try to prescribe aggressive treatments to get things in better control	1
6	before the severe pain started, my bs started climbing and when the pain got really severe my bs  went higher than it ever does (i usually keep a1c's below 6)	1

5.4	well, according to my endo this week at joslin: my a1c was 5.4, and he said now of course this is a non-diabetic number	1
5.6	this is the lowest a1c i have ever had, once i had an 5.6 when first diagnosed	1
5.5	i had lost 65lbs, keep my bg levels normalized and my a1c in the 5.5 range	1
-	6.9 a1c and blood sugar up to 240 is far from normal and higher than pre-diabetic	1
5.7%	if you are overweight and have other risk factors then your dr may have thought that the a1c of 5.7% (which is at the top of normal) was a sign that you are heading towards pre diabetes and thus it was a good idea to repeat the test in october	1
12	prior to pump therapy, my a1c was always over 12	1
6.4	tml english hey friends-i went to the doctor on monday and she tested my a1c it wad 6.4	1
7	thanks everyone ;) a1c  &lt;7 is usually considered the goal because that was achieved in the dcct (diabetes control and complications trial)	1
6	the goal of the study was intensive bg management as close as possible to an a1c of 6 to study the effect on long-term complications of diabetes	1
7	study participants were able to get below an a1c of 7 and saw dramatic reductions in risk of complications	1
6.4	my a1c was 6.4 when i was dx	1
5.8	at one time an a1c of 5.8 was considered the high end of normal for someone without diabetes&hellip;i'm not sure that still holds	1
6.0	thank you :) i recently  saw a neurologist for my neuropathy and he strongly recommended an a1c of less than 6.0 to prevent the neuropathy from progressing and avoiding further complications	1
5.6	i am on insulin and i have lost 10 pounds in 3 months and my a1c is 5.6	1
5.7	as a type ii diabetic the highest my blood sugar was 250, that's when i was diagnost but with oral meds once a day and loosing 53 lbs, along with daily exercise, my blood sugar is averaging 94, and a1c is at 5.7	1
8.5	first time in life part of physicals revealed my a1c at 8.5	1
5.2	and it helps more now when my last a1c is 5.2 and my doctor said he may change my meds or lower my meds	1
6.5	i have a fairly strict diet, exercise every day and my thought is that if i can keep my a1c at or below 6.5 i'd be happy as getting off meds has always been my goal	1
7.4	now this&hellip; i have been off all diabetic medications since my bariatric surgery but found that my bs daily was sliding up even though i am still losing weight,  so after my last labs where my a1c was 7.4, i elected to go back on metformin	1
6.5	an a1c of 6.5 is my target	1
5.7	my goal for 2015 is to maintain my weight loss and get my a1c down to 5.7 or lower	1
6	mine is every 3 months but i am on insulin type 2 hello  you can get a a1c test at the drug store thats quick but my doc dose one every 6 months or so but i am under good controil hope this helps h my dr	1

7	golas are to get my a1c level below 7 and keep it there	1
1	the a1c test shows that she could be getting closer to t1 as the oral medications aren't giving her as good of control as they would like	1
1	she lost over 11 lbs in 6wks which we thought was great because she had been working hard, however they also said the weight loss could be another factor for her getting closer to t1&hellip; because the a1c was higher it prompted other tests to be ran, without the a1c they would not have known there was a change other than some higher bgl's she'd been having with no explanation of why they were higher	1
7.0	to my understanding the a1c is supose to be below 7.0 for diabetics	1
3	the a1c is very important and really needs to be done every 3 mos	1

7	for example, an avg 8.3 mmol which is the same as an average 150 mg/dl would yield an a1c of 7	1
3	a checkup of a1c every 3 months is highly recommended	1
6.0	it was 5.9  &amp; i need to have it recheck in july when i go back to the doctor last a1c in april was 6.0	1
6.7	my last a1c was 6.7 and was in may	1
6.5	hummm  went to my dr yesterday and she would not increase the metformin, i take 1000mg a day but said if my a1c was over 6.5 she would	1
3	do you know what your a1c is (that's a lab test that the doc does to see what your average reading has been over the last 3 months)	1
5.9	i lost 75 pounds and my a1c is at 5.9 &hellip; so working for me	1
3	i have been using the bayer a1c home test kit for about 3 years now	1
1	a1c tells you how you've done over the last few months but the daily readings show if there is an issue before you have the a1c	1
14.1	annette boofy   feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1	1
7.0	my a1c has never been below 7.0 since i was first diagnosed with diabetes	1
5.5%	i have kept my fasting bg levels in the normal range and achieved an a1c of 5.5%	1
6	make sure to keep your a1c in the 6 range	1
7.4	my a1c is 7.4 and lowering	1
7.4	i was diagnosed in may with a 10.5 a1c, in september it was down to around 7.4 i think	1
14.1	ood luck feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1	1
6	my a1c did not change that drastically, but i was only on it like 6 months	1
7.4	before i had my a1c done (7.4) i had a couple of free screenings at a little clinic sponsored by publix grocery stores	1
7.8	that would be most appreciated james my a1c is 7.8	1
1	i have been struggling terribly, just terribly , to get my a1c up, but, it was found when i was in the emergency room about a year ago that my red blood cells turn over at a much much higher rate than normal, meaning, i have rarely been able to get an accurate a1c, so what i'm doing is focusing on trying to raise it	1
5.9	yeah, i know it seems backwards, but it's not&mdash;i feel bad at an a1c of 5.9, and no, i am nowhere near being pre-diabetic	1
1	it continues to frustrate me beyond belief that i can't really talk about my a1c with most other diabetics, as my blood does not do a good job at all really of showing an accurate a1c	1
8.1	and they told me that my a1c is down to 8.1	1
5.4	my a1c is 5.4&hellip;don't listen to the dead guy	1
6	for years, i was able to eat 120 total carb grams per day and keep my hba1c in the 6's	1
6.9	my last a1c was 6.9	1
7	my highest ever hba1c was in the low/mid 7's	1
5.8	little puzzled because my first a1c went diagnosed in july was 5.8	1
5	bydureon is not prescribed for weight loss specifically&hellip;but i do anticipate that my a1c shall drop below 5 on this med	1
12.8	my a1c was 12.8	1
12.5	my latest a1c has dropped down to 12.5	1
13.2	my a1c was 13.2&hellip; which we all know is horrible	1
5.2	a1c was 5.2	1
2	managing your "abc's" (a1c, blood pressure, cholesterol) is common for a lot of type 2 diabetics &hellip; certainly is for me	1
9.2	figured the a1c would be high, but was shocked to see it was 9.2	1
6.5	my dr put me on metformin because a1c was 6.5 and now i am tired beyond belief	1
6.5	your doctor put you on metformin because you had an a1c of 6.5	1
-	a1c readings are a measure of the 30 day half life of your bg level	1
5.7	a1c is 5.7	1
6.6	my last a1c in august was 6.6	1
6.0	tml english i finally got a real good doctor, got my levels where they need to be and a great a1c (6.0), and felt halfway normal again, i got hurt at work	1
5	his a1c was 5 and his other numbers were great	1
6.3	see, i was diagnosed with t2d in 2005 and ever since my a1c has been in the 6.3 range - well controlled for years	1
13	an a1c of 13 means that you will have complications soon, amputations, blindness, heart attack, that type of thing	1
13	you say that you have cut out all carb and are 125lbs and still have an a1c of 13 then you will have to take something	1
5.8	my bs goes from as low as 21 to 300 and above but my a1c is 5.8 or ave	1
1	the chart is just great to have as a guideline as to what your a1c can possibly be if your blood glucose is kept within a certain parameter, it should never be used to replace an actual hba1c test administered by your physician	1
1	~mays~ it's accurate when you move from a1c to bgs because a1c is an average that takes into consideration all of the specific readings, high and low	1
3	that would make it appear that your a1c reading bounces around all over in the course of a day and it doesn't because it's based in 3 months of cellular damage as read in the blood cells	1
12	my a1c levels averaged about a 12	1
6	and mya1c level at my last checkup was a 6 i haven't had any side affects to speak of	1
7	i began experiencing severe hypos in 2009 with my a1c's creeping up into the 7's; my pcp kept increasing my lantus dosage and advised me to decrease my mealtime novolog bolus dosage	1
5.4	my last a1c was 5.4 which didn't make any sense to me either since my sugars stay so high, but then again that was taken right after my daughter was born when i was still on insulin	1
6.8	my a1c was great&hellip; 6.8	1
3	you should be having an a1c every 3 mos	1
16.9	when i first diagnosed with diabetes my a1c was 16.9	1
-	actually the a1c is like a snapshot of the average  of your bg levels over the last 90 days	1
3	a1c is a measure of glucose that are attached to your red blood cells for the last 3 months to see how well you have managed your blood sugar	1
-	if yours only live 60 days then your a1c will be a lot lower than somebody who's live 120 days if all other factors are the same	1
9	he did blood work and my a1c was 9	1
6.8	that has allowed me to maintain my weight at 120  pounds and my last a1c was 6.8 which is considered good for a person with diabetes	1
7	maybe the a1c of 7 is a little high for you, but it is not so high as to do you harm in the short term	1
7	going back to those drugs are worse than an  a1c of 7 for now	1
8	doc told me just take 500 in morn only take 500 at night    if it was 160 or higher   since then a1c  has been going up   this has been about 8 month journey diabetes is a crazy disease, there are no definitive norms to it	1
-	before my last a1c i tested and it said 80	1
11.9	thanks my dr wasn't happy with my a1c initial it was 11.9 but i'm doing better just still trying to get things adjusted but thanks for the advice	1
5.5%	i also follow a high protein, low carb meal plan for 3+ yrs now and i had initially  lost  65 lbs,over 5 mo stopped taking my twice daily injection of nph insulin, kept my bg (blood glucose) levels in the vicinity of 80 to 130 mg/dl and achhieved an a1c of 5.5%  i have written up that meal plan and i offer it to anyone who asks	1
14	yes done the denial thing, still do sometimes, i'm bad about testing, my last a1c was 14 and i have got to get on track	1
25%	tml english the a1c accounts for less than 25% of the variation in risks of diabetes complications	1
5.1%	i have managed to stay off medicine, lowered my cholesterol back to a normal range, and my last a1c was 5.1%	1
5.6	he other thing that thrilled me was my a1c was 5.6 which continues to improve	1
14	on the pump my highest a1c was 14	1
11	but after some scary sugar numbers an a1c of 11 and having all the problems i started caring	1
6	i am now limiting myself to 115 grams and, if that doesn't get my a1c back into the 6's, i'll have to cut back even more	1
7	my a1c had crept up into the 7's	1
14	my a1c was 14 &mdash; so i qualified for oral surgery to remove what is left of my teeth	1
7	right now i haven't had any eye problems and to keep it that way is to have a1c under 7	1
5.7	thankfully, my eyes are fine and my a1c is 5.7, so i'm not anticipating problems	1
6.6	glad you are doing well also i just had my a1c checked and it was 6.6 i thought i was doing well, but not sure now	1
6.1	my a1c is currently 6.1	1
6.0	since being diagnosed as a diabetic, i have not been able to get my a1c below 6.0	1
-	merry christmas &amp; hope we can get our a1c lower in 2012	1
3	so outside of the expense of doing the a1c every 3 months, that would probably be the only difference	1
3	so outside of the expense of doing the a1c every 3 months, that would probably be the only difference	1
3	so outside of the expense of doing the a1c every 3 months, that would probably be the only difference	1
3	so outside of the expense of doing the a1c every 3 months, that would probably be the only difference	1
7	i have always kept my a1c well under that magic number 7	1
13	this surprises me as my a1c has been over 13 for the past three years	1
13	an a1c over 13 is extremely high	1
14.1	feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1	1
6.8	i function very well on 120 grams of carb per day and my last a1c was 6.8&hellip;still room to improve there	1
6%	i found i have to keep it under 45 per meal for my a1c to be 6% though	1
3	i'm not sure what you mean by that (being re-diagnosed) as my bg levels and a1c's and bloodwork have been very good for going on 3 years since he and i started working on things together	1
5	in less than a year i got my a1c down to a 5	1
5.4	i have been trying to practice tight control&hellip; i currently have an a1c of 5.4	1
6.1	i went on dialysis and continued my life   my a1c had never been below 6.1 (to my knowledge) even after the nph	1
5	i've had insulin, but now my blood sugars are so unstable, along with a low a1c, that insulin is out of the question&mdash;-i am allergic to metformin, and my pancreas also rejected it when i was on that 5 years ago	1
5.9	he said that neither type 1 nor type 1 would have a range like that&hellip;way too out of range for a type 2, but never would a type 1 have an a1c of 5.9, unless something extreme was going on	1
7.2	but my last a1c was at 7.2	1
1	9-10 a1c is bad but blood sugar in mmol/l is not super awesome but not massively bad and is actually pretty great for a newly diagnosed type 1	1
6.2	my problems are more nerve problems, such as spinal stenosis and pinched nerve in hip (not sure if diabetes complication or not as my a1c is 6.2) anyway, the best medicine is prevention	1
6.0	also i've tried and control my blood sugar as best i can with an a1c of around 6.0	1
6.0	an a1c of 6.0 is great but only reflects the average of your bg	1
6.0	an a1c of 6.0 is extremely good	1
11.2	my bs levels was t290 and my a1c was 11.2	1
6.1	two months ago when i went for my routine check up this year, my a1c was 6.1	1
6	this will result in your a1c in the 6's which is perfectly fine	1
6.6	my a1c is down to 6.6 so i'm getting there but still not quite there yet	1
4	since my goal is to have normal a1cs in the 4's&hellip;it was a little disappointing&hellip;all of my other health markers are perfect	1
5.8	my last a1c was 5.8	1
5.0	i don't have a clue how i am running now&hellip;stopped testing after my blood was drawn for my last a1c&hellip;i wanted to have a solid marker to measure by&hellip;changed my diet up a bit&hellip;more carbs&hellip;i had cherries yesterday (grin)&hellip;i missed cherries&hellip; girl a 5.0 is very respectable and give yourself some time	1
6.0	i am on citalopram, since 1st week in october and my 12/31 a1c was 6.0, so i am ok on it	1
1	medical texts that deal with the a1c say that you should not base any diagnostic or treatment decisions off an a1c when the patient has an iron deficiency	1
6	yet one of those times her a1c was somewhere in the 6s	1
1	there will be other a1c tests later on and you can affect those a1c by keeping your bg (blood glusose) under better control	1
1	praying for better future a1c for you   james i agree with what type1lou stated	1
1	while strict control the week before you blood test might make your a1c a bit lower, the a1c will reflect the average of your control over the past several months	1
1	rather than controlling your bg levels to "pass" this a1c, concentrate your efforts on gaining better consistently overall control so that the following a1c will show better results	1
5.9	just got my a1c back at 5.9	1
7	were you able to keep your a1c under 7	1
7	a1c, around the 7 mark	1
9.3	my a1c i belive is 9.3 or something like that	1
7.7	the a1c is 7.7 and i keep trying to bring it down	1
6.2	so, it came to a shock to me when my a1c came out at 6.2	1
5.9	with the meter i am using my fasting blood sugar has averaged 91 for the last 6 months and my a1c is at 5.9 so i'm assuming things are okay	1
5.9	an a1c of 5.9 is good and your average sounds like you are under good control	1
7.0	my mom has a pacemaker (recent) and i have heart disease and had a stent put in 2 years ago (i'm only 47)  my  parents were diagnosed years ago while i was "assumed" to be type 2 because of my heart disease (my a1c is less than 7.0)	1
4	my last a1c was great and i had only been on medication for 4 months	1
6.0	i will need to have at least two but preferably three a1c below 6.0 before i will be convinced that i can stop the metformin	1
6.0	according to my doctor, i don't need to lose anymore weight but my a1c is still above 6.0	1
5.5	a1c is 5.5	1
14	my a1c was in the 14 range and my other tests were not so peachy either	1
6.0	went got a1c and it was 6.0that was in jan	1
5.9	but don't take my word for it, do the research for yourself-between using that and splenda my a1c is now 5.9	1
6	john i use splenda and my a1c is 6	1
5.9	my last a1c was 5.9	1
6.7	when i started to get off insulin i was at 9 on the a1c scale and now i am at 6.7 which is a major accomplishment for me	1
6.1	i don't remember what my numbers were at the time i went off my meds, it was too long ago, but the last time my a1c was at 6.1, which the dr	1
5%	since the a1c is an average, it's said the accuracy is about .5% either way	1
7.5	i have bee a diabetic for only a short a so far my bs has never gone over 200 an my a1c highest has only7.5 but i was lucky my dr	1
4.8	my mother's a1c had gotten down to 4.8 so they took her off of her metformin	1
6.5%	as long as you are able to control your sugars, so have a hba1c 6.5% or less, you can push off the complications of diabetes for many years	1
6.0	now my a1cs are consistently below 6.0	1
12	i am not real trustful of the medical community right now because a neurosurgeon wanted to do major spine surgery on me with an a1c of 12	1
8.8	in early january for a physical and my fasting blood sugar was 225 and a1c was 8.8	1
7.2	on my second visit to the dr, my a1c dropped to 7.2	1
7.5	hope we can be friends&hellip;valentine lady i'm a type 2 diabetic and my a1c is now 7.5	1
6.8	you have done a super job with your a1c to 6.8	1
5	i was functionally cured of type 1 diabetes with an islet cell tranplant through the chicago diabetes project and have had normal blood sugars and a1c's for 5 years now	1
10.5	my a1c is 10.5, so i am willing to try anything to help lower my sugars	1
10.5	blessed be vicki omg, are you kidding me your a1c is 10.5	1
6.4	last a1c was 6.4	1
2	metformin did a lot to keep my blood glucose in order during a 2-year study i did with the university of minnesota comparing gastric bypass surgery with intensive medical treatment to lower a1c's in t2 diabetics	1
5	you would not believe how many diabetics i know  who tell me they are taking metformin and their a1c is 5	1
6	i had had my a1c levels in the mid to lower 6s	1
5.8	i track my numbers between 96 and 104 with an a1c of 5.8	1
6.0	i was having good a1c's (below 6.0) but i had a lot of highs and lows	1
6.1	current a1c is 6.1 and even though i would like to gain a little weight, get rid of some of the neuropathy, and arthritis pain; i realize this isn't going to happen and so continue to do what i can, when i want to and let the chips fall where they may	1
14.1	feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1	1
6	talk to your doctor and see what they say about how you can work together to keep an a1c around 6	1
13.2	but i started out at 388 fasting bg and a1c of 13.2	1
5.5%	i accidentally discovered that my pancreas was producing enough insulin on its own  when i discovered that i stopped the insulin and was able to keep my fasting bg levels in the 80 to 130 mg/dl range and achieve an a1c of 5.5%	1
6	because i will feel fully confident to take it when i still have just a little bit more food coming in&hellip;i now work 2 jobs, and my income has come up a pretty good amount, but, my biggest fear is taking insulin and having even just one night with little or nothing in my refrigerator&hellip;maybe that's what the guy you go to church with is worried about&hellip;my biggest fear is an insulin reaction&hellip;i am almost petrified of any low below an 80, as my body does not handle lows well at all&hellip;i can be at 400 and feel on top of the world&hellip;but, the few times i do go low, when i stupidly skip a meal, and then go for a big run&hellip;then i will fall down to 83, and it just is not good&hellip;so, just to explain it better to you : i had insulin given to me because i would have died otherwise, but, the metformin which i turned out to be allergic to, and my pancreas rejected, it set my a1c waaaay down&hellip;to the point where it gave me a light heart attack&hellip;so, that's why i still do not feel fully comfortable with insulin everyday&hellip;sooner or later i will be on it everyday&hellip;but, i am putting it off&hellip;so i can keep making sure i have enough to eat first&hellip;it is amazing what one bad experience will do to a person&hellip;since that metformin, i still have never been the same, and it's been a whole 6 years&mdash;-it almost sent me into a diabetic coma i found out&mdash;-and i took it for a whole year and a half&mdash;&mdash;so, it put my body into a state of low shock&mdash;&mdash;-i am just very very very relieved that i responded so beautifully to the insulin, as i thought the insulin would make me go down lower yet&mdash;-it did not&mdash;&mdash;it actually stabilized my blood sugars &hellip;i hope all is going well for you	1
6.0	me and my friend are in an a1c competition we have the same endo, and we're racing to reach 6.0 so we check in every three months to review progress and tips	1
14.1	feb 2009 i was diagnosed with a fasting blood sugar of 366 and a1c of 14.1	1
8.4	tml english hi friends,   i checked my a1c yesterday and it was 8.4 and i am very upset with my readings and i am planning to get a insulin pump if it suits me	1
13.4	tml english i'm type 1 diabetic, went to my doctor yesterday and found out my a1c test was 13.4, which is very bad	1
3	your a1c is a 3 month average of your blood sugar represented in percentage	1
1	i think i am not trying to fool anyone since an a1c will tell all and my last a1c was so much better then the previous one	1
-	i had just taken my a1c test on friday and then out of the blue, saturday my numbers went to over 400 for the first time	1
13	tml english i have been working for the past three on bringing down my a1c from 13	1
6.5	my a1c is now 6.5 and i have no diabetic nurse support&hellip;   i hope you all will help me to stay on track&hellip;i do not crave food anymore&hellip;but   i am scared to exercise because my blood sugar drop too low with it&hellip;i have to develop a better plan&hellip;help	1
8.1	james congradations i am working on the same my a1c was off the chart when i was first diagnosed and i am currently at 8.1 need to get a little more	1
10.8	my a1c in january was 10.8 very high	1
6	mine is to see my a1c in the 6 range	1
7.7	yet i have no diabetic symptoms, my a1c is 7.7 (not fantastic, but not terrible either) and i am getting healthier	1
4	tml english i've been to the doctor for my six month checkup and i found that the doctor thinks my glucose and a1c levels are getting better and i've lost 4 pounds since then	1
20.9	i have reversed much of the damage from when i was badly out of control (a1c 20.9) when i was first talking to me medical team they said i was probably just a miracle patient	1
5.0	my last a1c was 5.0 without any meds	1
6.1	now all i use is vinegar as i take 2-3 tsp mixed with a little water before each meal and it helps keep my levels down greatly and don't take any medication and last a1c was 6.1 so very happy with results is there a particular type vinegar that you are taking	1
5.9	now w/my last a1c being 5.9	1
5.5	i kept my blood glucose between 80 and 130 most days and i lost about 65 lbs and maintained an a1c of 5.5	1
6.5	with the help of metformin, i was able to keep my a1c below 6.5 the whole time, until recently	1
7.0	i never stuck to my diet cause it never did change my a1c when i did, when i was put on lantus it briefly went to 7.0	1
10.1	imagine my horror when my a1c was 10.1	1
7.0	i was very sick for six years, the lowest my a1c ever was was 7.0 and that was only temporary and when lantus was introduced	1
7.0	i never stuck to my diet cause it never did change my a1c when i did, when i was put on lantus it briefly went to 7.0	1
10.1	imagine my horror when my a1c was 10.1	1
7.0	i was very sick for six years, the lowest my a1c ever was was 7.0 and that was only temporary and when lantus was introduced	1
10.1	i even lived on 600 calories the winter of 2013, and imagine the horror as he told me my a1c was 10.1	1
6.1	so how do i do this without screwing up the progress i have made with my diabetes (recent a1c was 6.1)	1
3	your a1c has gone down in only 3 months, is it the meds or the way you are eating	1
9	if your a1c was 9, you are a diabetic, but sometimes underlying illnesses can imatate diabetes, like a thyroid condition or taking statin drugs	1
5.8	my last a1c was5.8	1
6	i'll echo that sentiment, i went off met after briefly starting it when my a1c got down to 6, but the doctor saw i was actively working on it	1
6.5	my last a1c was 6.5 and i am still on metformin	1
7.3	an a1c of 7.3 is not a good time to stop metformin	1
5.0	everyone i know who is off of metformin and maintain with diet and exercise was taken off when their a1c was a 5.0   you could also get a second opinion however, if you are diabetic, it is easier once you accept the fact that you have it	1
7	keep a1c below 7&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-let me tell you, portion control at meals is important	1
2	i would also see about having one check you a1c and have them give you your diag, of type 2	1
6.3	my a1c level was high but below "diabetic" standards, i kept it under 6.3	1
8	now i am diabetic with an a1c of 8 and take metformin	1
7	according to the info i'd been given, an a1c of 7 means that you definitely have diabetes and it is not in good control	1
5.4	my last a1c was 5.4 after losing all the weight, and exercising more, eating right most of the time	1
6.0	in my case, and for many reasons, i keep my a1c around 6.0	1
5.4	hi jigsaw , i "try" to keep my daily carb intake about 150 gm  with my last meal (dinner) being the majority&hellip;i am still learning about carbs but have managed to maintain an a1c of 5.4 since my diagnosis last year	1
5.4	an a1c of 5.4 is better then good, it's great	1
6.8	my last a1c was 6.8	1
